
	This year has been a wakeup call for many, and I am proud to be running to represent Washingtonians of all stripes during this tumultuous time.  
    More than ever, we need leadership that takes the responsibility of the office seriously.  
    
    I respect the Constitution.  I am that leader.

“The two pillars of democratic government,” states renowned economist Ludwig von Mises, “are the primacy of the law and the budget.”

  I agree, and am concerned when all I see are non-stop attempts to knock these pillars over.

The abuse of our budget is so flagrant that the resulting harm has become impossible for the average American to ignore. 
 I vow as your Congressman to restore trust in our laws, transparency in our process and reign in the abundant wasteful spending. 
  
  This year’s $5 trillion dollars in stimulus with almost no oversight is only the latest example of misuse of taxpayer money in favor of enriching special interests.
I will also work to remove subsidies that do nothing but make goods and services more expensive and enrich campaign donors, and advocate for removing regulatory barriers that prevent our most brilliant engineers from creating innovative solutions to our problems.  
At the same time, I will use my vote to keep us out of never-ending wars of occupation, sparing our brave men and women in uniform from unnecessary horrors while saving us trillions of dollars.  I did not and would not have voted for the Patriot Act and the Iraq War.  The same can not be said for my opponent.
“Democracy is not a good that people can enjoy without trouble,” Mises once said.  “It is, on the contrary, a treasure that must be daily defended and conquered anew by strenuous effort.”  Join me in reclaiming our Democracy from those that would harm it.

Just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in the world due to global competition, so does free-trade among all nations/peoples allows the best ideas to compete and spread globally thus ensuring the best possible global order.
