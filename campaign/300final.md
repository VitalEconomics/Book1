The purpose of my campaign is what the great free-market economist Ludwig von Mises called “the primary civic duty”: to spread an understanding of economic freedom. 
Our freedom to trade our hard-earned wealth for what we desire motivates all companies (competitors) to discover the best information. 
They have to learn from each other to successfully compete for our business. 
Otherwise they won’t make enough to pay a competitive wage, so employees use their freedom to quit and join the better-informed companies. 
True economic freedom, without government regulations picking winners and losers, doesn’t lead to chaos. It “turns on” economic competition. The actions of free people work together like a supercomputer, constantly discovering and spreading better information throughout society. 
This shapes our very morals and culture too. Hard-working, tolerant, and courteous people are not forced out of the market by the government’s corporate cronies, and as they gain public trust, they force everyone else to be likewise. In the Olympics, we discover the world’s best athletes through global competition. 
In the same way, free trade among all peoples allows the best ideas to spread globally, ensuring the best possible global order. Governments and public sectors are immune to these incentives that motivate the private sector to be hard-working, efficient, and innovative. 
They are coercive MONOPOLIES that simply take the products of our labor through taxes, so they mostly waste our wealth and have us blindly fighting over who gets to control it. Freedom is “The Ultimate Algorithm.” It shapes our socioeconomic order and our civilized morals, and is indispensable for discovering the truth. Please help me continue the work of Mises, who urged us: “The issues of society’s economic organization are every citizen’s business. To master them to the best of one’s ability is the duty of everyone.”

The purpose of my campaign is what the great free-market economist Ludwig von Mises called “the primary civic duty”: to spread an understanding of economic freedom and real Capitalism. 

The 'freedom to trade' our hard-earned wealth for what we desire with fellow human beings anywhere in the world transforms billions of free people into a global super-computer where all companies are motivated to innovate and learn from each other thus inadvertently cooperating to discover the best information with which to serve customers and reorder all of mankind. Otherwise they won't get enough revenue to pay a competitive wage, motivating employees to use their freedom to quit and join the increasingly better-informed higher-paying companies. Freedom and the competition and thus discovery and spread of superior information that emerges from it also shapes our morals and culture, because it is hard-working, tolerant, and courteous people, who thanks to competition, motivate everyone else to be likewise. 

Governments are coercive competition-less inefficient monopolies which waste most of our wealth/taxes and prevent us from spending it on more desirable and productive private sector alternatives thus killing the private sector jobs such spending would sustain. the productio
 
Freedom is "The Ultimate Algorithm", it created our socioeconomic order thus our very lives, civilized our morals, is indispensable for discovering the truth, and is the very opposite of tyranny.

“Economics deals with society’s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen.” —Mises

----------------------------


"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.

The more the government regulates, the more it paralyzes competitive knowledge discovery. As government regulations have increased in the health care sector, turning it into a sort of island of paralyzed top-down competition-less/socialist central planning, so have costs. These increased costs have led the sector to grow from consuming just 1.6% of the American economic pie in 1960 to 4.2% in 1980 to a whopping 16% in 2006 and about 18% by 2017


“Economics deals with society’s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen.”—Ludwig von Mises

 

“Economic history is a long record of government policies that failed because they were designed with a bold disregard for the laws of economics.”—Ludwig von Mises

The purpose of my campaign is to do what the great free-market economist Ludwig von Mises referred to as “the primary civic duty”: to spread an understanding of economic freedom.  Why are BMW, Ford, Microsoft, Google, Apple and all private sector companies constantly innovating and copying each other’s innovations thus reordering society in more prosperous states as fast as humanly possible/profitable?
Because free human beings, in our role as consumers thanks to the tradition of ‘private property’ , have the ‘economic freedom to trade’ our hard-earned wealth for what we deem best. This ‘economic freedom’, as opposed to leading to chaos and ‘social injustice’ which is what the economically ignorant believe,  is what inadvertently “turns on” ‘economic competition’ and resulting socioeconomic order/life.  As cost-cutting ideas emerge and inevitably spread via competition leading relative prices to continuously fall, new profitable ideas arise and once again spread via competition in an endless cycle of knowledge generation/innovation/prosperity. Originally computers were very expensive, but continued competition/innovation made them cheaper/better/smaller which gave birth to our computerized world and the Internet and all the great things that flow from it. The more wealth is produced, the more wealth has to be offered in exchange for labor as entrepreneurs/companies/orders compete against each other for the labor they need which helps explain why the economic pie grows for everyone. Governments, being coercive MONOPOLIES which get their life-sustaining wealth through taxes/compulsion are thus immune to the competitive incentives which motivate the private sector to be efficient and innovative so they mostly waste our wealth and have us ignorantly arguing/fighting over how to control it. Mises again: “The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone.”

In 1915, British physicist Henry Mosely, who would have probably won the Nobel Prize that year, died in perhaps the most disastrous error mankind has thus far made, WWI. Bright and pious German/French/British/Russian… students, fathers, engineers, "great minds" and "experts", who even shared a common European Christian faith, reverted to their tribal ape-like nature, and for God, honor, flag and country, slaughtered each other leading to about 18 million deaths. Why does mankind keep getting involved in these disasters!?

The great intellectual slayer of Socialism, Ludwig von Mises believed that if we didn't teach economic freedom and Capitalism to "the immense majority", then "there is no hope left for mankind". He is right! When are we going to end the economic ignorance that has citizens going along and even morally encouraging these counterproductive Coronavirus lockdowns that have allowed hordes economically ignorant 'well-meaning scholars' like Dr. Anthony Fauci and numerous Governors to destroy our freedom and economic prosperity? Mises' protégé and 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics Friedrich Hayek nails it below: 

"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." 

"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced."

Our freedom to choose transforms billions of free people into a global super-computer where all companies are motivated to innovate and learn from each other thus inadvertently cooperate to discover the best information with which to serve customers and reorder all of mankind. Freedom and competition, not coercive competition-immune government monopoly by 'experts', is what made America the greatest country on earth. Mises and Hayek saved us from Communism, now we must save ourselves from Coromunism by spreading the econogospel.

Based on a quickly-revised and later totally discredited "epidemiological model" which grossly overestimated the lethality of the Coronavirus pathogen, in about 2 months the Coronavirus-related economic shutdowns and restrictions which have been strongly advised by 'well-meaning scholars' like Dr. Anthony Fauci have led to over 38+ million Americans losing their jobs and have the USA and much of the world headed towards a WWI-like tribalistic socioeconomic calamity which might very well be mankind's Final Disaster. The three aforementioned calamities all have one common root. Massive ignorance of how the socioeconomic order works! As 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek tells us:

"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." 

"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced."
