The purpose of my campaign is to do what the great free-market economist Ludwig von Mises referred to as “the primary civic duty”: to spread an understanding of economic freedom/Capitalism.

The 'freedom to trade' our hard-earned wealth for what we desire motivates all companies (competitors) to discover superior information and learn from each other in order to successfully compete for our business, otherwise they won't get enough revenue to pay their employees a competitive wage so they use their freedom to quit and join the superiorly informed companies. 

Thus 'economic freedom', as opposed to leading to chaos, is what “turns on” ‘economic competition’ which inadvertently transforms free people into a super-computer that is constantly discovering and spreading superior information and order throughout society and also shaping our very morals and culture too, because it is hard-working, tolerant, and courteous people, who thanks competition,  inevitably force everyone else to be likewise. Just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in the world due to global competition, so does free-trade among all nations/peoples allows the best ideas to compete and spread globally thus ensuring the best possible global order.

Governments or public sectors in general are coercive MONOPOLIES which get their wealth through taxes and are thus immune to the competitive incentives which motivate the private sector to be hard-working, efficient and innovative, so they mostly waste our wealth and have us ignorantly fighting over who gets to control it. 
 
Thus we can see that freedom is "The Ultimate Algorithm", it shapes our socioeconomic order, our civilized morals, and is also indispensable for discovering the truth. Please help me continue Mises' work: “The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone.” - Mises
