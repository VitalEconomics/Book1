Why is it that products in the IT sector get cheaper and better every year so that even the poor can afford amazing phones which the wealthiest could not imagine 30 years ago, yet the healthcare sector gets more expensive all the time and went from consuming about 5% of our income in 1960 to about 20% today? In the regulated healthcare sector what a person must learn in order to legally offer medical advice via licensing of doctors, where he must learn it via licensing of medical schools, how to test drugs, how the medical insurance industry should work and much more is dictated by monopolistic competition-less bureaucracies like the AMA, the FDA and numerous others. By comparison, the IT sector has very few regulations so competition motivates the creation and spread of superior information at breakneck speeds. I would deregulate the industry thus making it more competitive/innovative/cheaper/better instead of the usual economically ignorant/socialist solution of just taxing more.


I am agnostic. I do have a deep appreciation of religion and especially the Abrahamic faiths given their monumental impact in the history and emergence of Western Civilization. I have been to Bethlehem, visited the Western Wall, and Al-Aqsa Mosque. Being born in Cuba, a Latin American country, I was baptized and grew up under Roman Catholicism.


Under the circumstances agreed upon by citizens via their local municipalities. I am personally pro-choice in the sense that I don't believe it should be considered murder to have an abortion. I personally find late-term abortions to be rather abhorrent unless performed due to medical/safety reasons relating to mother or fetus. What I am against is one national or state-wide policy which coerces everyone to go along with a monopoly decision by one group against the wishes of others.

No, racism on its own is hardly a factor. The real issue is the economic ignorance that leads to laws which exacerbate it. For example, the War on Drugs makes it easy for racist white cops to harass and ruin the lives of many African Americans and is one of the most significant causes of our racial problems. High minimum wage laws also makes it impossible to profitably hire many black teenagers leading to current unemployment rates of nearly 30% (49% in 2010) preventing them from getting the skills/experience needed to be more productive and get higher paying jobs. This unemployment further motivates many to deal drugs with its dangerous risks and eventually get caught which ruins their lives, even if they actually never stole or harmed anyone. Since the economically ignorant thinks Capitalism is bad and modern Capitalism arose in Europe and thus took white men to relative dominance, there is an increasing anti-white male sentiment that is leading to further polarization.


To a significant degree radical Islam is a result of mankind's inability to properly solve the Israeli/Palestinian conflict which has the region constantly embroiled in conflict and the inevitable radicalization that war and poverty, as opposed to peace and commerce, bring. Christian America was once a radical place where we burned "witches", had we been embroiled in constant conflict which heightened our religious fervor, instead of the centuries of relative peace and commerce which "civilized" us, we too would have had our more relative "radical" elements, why? Because we are equally human. If we finally solve the conflict in a manner that soothes the Islamic world's understandable frustrations and can then focus on peace, trade, and commerce, the more radical elements will be likewise "civilized" away just like happened with us, why? Because we are equally human. I am thoroughly convinced we can have peace and prosperity and blame no one for our troubles, why? :-)

How would you guarantee Social Security benefits for future generations?

I would work to phase out and end Social Security in a manner that provides adequate assistance to those who are currently very dependent on it. Nobody should be made a criminal for refusing to pay into a monopolistic socialist Ponzi scheme ran by a bunch of economically clueless paper-pushers in Washington DC.


1)In the last 102 years mankind, regardless of its "experts" and "great leaders", has been involved in two massive world wars and has been close to nuclear annihilation many times, if we continue to roll the dice at this rate, especially with nuclear armed China and Russia, mankind will prove to be an evolutionary dead end. My main priority will be to work to help sooth the deteriorating relationship with China and Russia and help get us all on a path to free-trade and vital nuclear reduction/disarmament. This focus on foreign policy also includes the vital Israeli/Palestinian conflict which is an important factor in the polarizations which lead to wars.2)I would work to greatly decrease taxes(end IRS/Income Tax) so that workers keep much more of their money and we create a private sector employment boom that will provide private sector jobs for all the newly laid off former government employees.3) Work to end the racist War on Drugs that is a main source of our race-related troubles.

I would work to phase out the Federal Reserve so that the US government could no longer tax/transfer wealth from Americans by simply creating money



Under NO circumstances should a taxpayer be coerced or be made a criminal for not wanting to pay someone else's student debt. It is precisely because the government made it easy to get a loan that millions of young Americans wasted the best years of their lives earning utterly useless degrees which did not increase their productivity, allowed state universities to raise tuitions, and now has frustrated and scared students clamoring for Socialism. Some kind of default would be preferable.



Everyone should be allowed to immigrate to the U.S. just like when the Statue of Liberty was there to really greet immigrants with:

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

A woman in a socialist country like my native Cuba might produce wealth at a rate of $4 per day, but by just moving to the US she can easily produce at at rate of say $5/hour leading to a 10-fold increase in rate of production and can now afford a much higher standard of living and also increase the sales profits of US businesses which now have someone who can afford their products instead of some poor Cuban who can't. This will motivate other countries to do likewise quickly evolving a global culture of mutual respect for all human beings free of nationalistic tribalisms

When countries allow foreign investment, they make it profitable for tools/factories to be shipped to poor countries that can increase the productivity of workers, but it is even better when the workers have the freedom to quickly move to and incorporate themselves with the already existing more productive and advanced companies wherever they are. 




Defund and repeal Obamacare, eliminate the Department of Labor, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Agriculture, Department of Education (DOE), Department of Commerce.


I would do more than balance the budget, I would greatly decrease it so that taxpayers keep much more of their money and we create a private sector employment boom that will provide private sector jobs for all the newly-laid-off former government employees. 
I would eliminate the Department of Labor, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Education (DOE), Department of Commerce. Close overseas U.S. military bases and bring troops home.
Close half of all domestic U.S. military bases.


Economist Ludwig von Mises wrote:

"As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics..This is, in our age, the primary civic duty..Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."

Our freedom to choose transforms billions of free people into a global super-computer where all companies are motivated to innovate and learn from each other thus inadvertently cooperate to discover and spread the best information with which to serve customers and reorder all of mankind. It is hard-working, courteous people who treat everyone with respect regardless of age/sex/religion/race who thanks to competition, inadvertently motivate everyone else to be likewise thus spreading superior morals/information. Freedom, not coercive competition-immune government monopoly by 'experts', is what made America the greatest country on earth. Freedom is "The Ultimate Algorithm"

If we destroy the freedom that created civilization,

I am for concealed and open carry of handguns and fully automatic assault weapons without permit. This 100% guarantees that the USA will never descend into tribalistic chaos or tyrannical dictatorship. Nobody should be deemed a criminal, no child should lose a parent, no woman should lose a husband, simply because he owns such weapons. 

Private businesses and communities should of course have the freedom to set their own rules regarding what is allowed on their property.

Libertarians like myself sometimes like to say that we are "fiscally conservative and socially liberal". So I am a bit of both, the best parts I hope! I have a good understanding of human nature and thus how alike we all are which helps me be very tolerant and aware of just how horrible/callous and also wonderful we can all be. I am the last person you will ever hear use the words "bad", and much less "evil", to describe someone or their actions. I always try to identify that key sequence of thoughts intertwined with a human nature we all share and circumstances when trying to understand why someone did wonderful or awful things. This applies to the awful "school shooters" and the "terrorists", they too had mothers who loved them and the potential to achieve great things. Whenever people use such labels they mistakenly blame the individual instead of the aforementioned factors which are what truly matter and keep us away from really making sense of and improving the world.
