# Intro

My name is Jorge Besada and I am running for Congress in Washington State' 9th District

I am computer guy, a contractor at Microsoft.

I was born in Cuba, a country destroyed by economic ignorance. The great free-market economics Ludwig von Mises felt it was 'the primary civic duty' to spread an understanding of economics, of the so-called free-market, of real Capitalism. I see things likewise, I too see it as my moral duty to help others overcome the economic fallacies that take us towards . So I would like to begin this introductory campaign video by quoting the great Mises which will nicely capture the essense of my campaing. 


"Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man's human existence…All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of…economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines…Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories…As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake…all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty....Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."


"The fact that the majority of our contemporaries, the masses of semi-barbarians led by self-styled intellectuals, entirely ignore everything that economics has brought forward, is the main political problem of our age. There is no use in deceiving ourselves. American public opinion rejects the market economy, the capitalistic free-enterprise system that provided the nation with the highest standard of living ever attained...

If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified "economic freedom," the system of free enterprise and capitalism....

The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone."

So in this inctroductory video I'd like to very quickly go over a few vital econmic concepts which every citizen should and can easily understand and later apply them to our current problems. 

Just like the human body is the result of the actions of over 30 trillion cells which are coordinated by various "systems"
like the respiratory, nervous, and digestive "systems", the global socioeconomic order is also coordinated by a "system", by what economists of the so-called 'Austrian School', like Ludwig von Mises and his great protégé 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek, referred to as "The Market Process". 'The Market Process' and the "parts" it is composed of like money, prices, economic competition, and interest rates is the process that coordinates the actions of nearly 8 billion human beings in a manner that they produce more wealth than they consume so they get to live.

Your life, the wealth you consume, the entire global economy and thus all of human civilization is the inadvertent result of a simple concept or better said, tradition. The concept of private property. Private property means that a person owns and has the freedom to use his property as he desires/calculates. Our freedom to trade our private property with anyone in the entire planet transforms billions of free people into a global super-computer where all companies are motivated to innovate and learn from each other thus inadvertently cooperate to discover superior information with which to serve customers and reorder all of mankind. For example, it is the freedom of customers to buy electric vehicles with the latest technologies from any company in the world, that motivates all other auto-manufacturers in the world to copy and thus spread the latest and greatest innovations throughout the world.
Companies that don’t successfully compete (innovate/learn) won’t get enough revenue to pay a competitive wage, motivating employees to once again use their freedom to trade, this time their labor, quit and join the increasingly better-informed higher-paying companies. This both, competitive and cooperative, process continuously innovates and reorders labor/resources in the most productive and prosperous way. Just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in the world due to global competition, so does free-trade among all nations/peoples/orders allows the best ideas to compete and spread globally thus ensuring the best possible global order. As cost-cutting ideas emerge and inevitably spread via competition leading prices to continuously fall, new profitable ideas easily arise and once again spread via competition in an endless cycle of knowledge generation/innovation. For example, computers were once very expensive, but once the price of making them came down enough, people easily realized that every home could have them, which gave birth to our computerized world and the Internet and all the great things that flow from it. The more wealth is produced, the more wealth has to be offered in exchange for labor as entrepreneurs/companies/orders compete against each other for the labor they need which helps explain why the economic pie grows for everyone. We should also quickly add that morals are simply ways of acting, they are knowledge, which like most knowledge, emerges and spreads via economic competition. Companies that hire/nourish/‘trade with’ lazy, disrespectful, or corrupt people will be less competitive and be inevitably pressured to hire people with better morals which in turn forces everyone to be respectful and hardworking regardless of race, sex, etc. Similarly, it is hard-working, tolerant, courteous people who thanks to competition inevitably force everyone else to be likewise. As Hayek tells us:

“Competition is, after all, always a process in which a small number makes it necessary for larger numbers to do what they do not like, be it to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work which without competition would not be needed.” (Hayek)

As millions of Italians, Britons, Germans and other immigrants from all over the world came to America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from ‘private property’ and thus individual liberty/freedom which stripped these people of their otherwise nationalistic/ethnocentric/tribalistic identities and evolved what came to be seen as the classic American character/ethos of wanting to be seen as a reputable/honest businessman/professional who treats everyone with respect and wears a business suit as opposed to older religious/ethnocentric dress. So not only does ‘private property’ “turn on” or leads to economic competition and other aspects of the market process and resulting social order/civilization, it also civilizes our morals.

Governmental/’public sector’ orders, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life/order-sustaining wealth through taxes/compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives/pressures which motivate private sector companies/individuals to be efficient/innovative/hard-working. This helps one understand how Communism, which abolishes competing private companies and replaces them with a single competition-less monopolistic bureaucracy run by "experts", leads to a massive lack of production/innovation and eventually socioeconomic chaos/starvation as the economic pie continuously shrinks as has happened in every country that consciously attempts Communism/Socialism or inadvertently drifts in that direction as their inefficient governments and public sectors get bigger and bigger (USA/Word).  Central plans can’t work if people are free to not go along with them — so they inevitably require compulsion/tyranny. For example, it is a criminal act in Communist countries like my native Cuba to start a business, in other words, to attempt a superior restructuring of society because it interferes with the plans of "the experts" who run the government. It is also a criminal act everywhere to not pay taxes that sustain public sector bureaucracies like “public education” so there is little incentive or wealth to sustain other, more desirable/superior competitors/alternatives. For example, the NYC public(monopolistic) school bureaucracy consumes about $29,000 per year to “educate” a K-12 student. Refusing to pay a single dollar that goes to this coercive bureaucracy is a criminal act. Taxes and all transfers of wealth from the private sector to the government, besides being an obvious detriment to the human beings that had to sacrifice a part of their lives to earn such wealth and now have less wealth to trade for the things they want, simply destroy the private sector jobs they taxes-away spending would have sustain and replaces such productive/efficient and pie-increasing jobs for inefficient government ones or worse like militarism/wars.

The former Soviet Union had plenty of highly educated scientists/'experts' whose plans required the coercion of millions, but they were thoroughly crushed by free Americans and their competitive knowledge discovery as they worked hard towards the American Dream. Socialist regimes and public sectors in general also face an "incentive problem." In free societies, or the private sector, each person/company is incentivized to be as productive as possible and keep inefficiencies to a minimum since he owns/keeps the additional wealth or losses. On the other hand, the government employee or bureaucrat gets the same pay (ability to then consume) whether his department did a good job (produced a lot) or not, and is also not risking his own wealth since that comes from the taxpayers. The image below is one of our most powerful memes for explaining the difference between competitive/private orders(South Korea) and monopolistic/government orders (North Korea). Again, keep your eye on how information arises/spreads and continuously restructures the social order.  

Regulations are just information not subject to continuous improvement via competition so they paralyze entire industries driving up costs. Compare the increasingly regulated/paralyzed healthcare sector which has grown from consuming about 5% of the economic pie in 1960 to nearly 20% today, to the free/competitive IT sector where even the poorest of Americans can afford amazing technology.
In the regulated/paralyzed healthcare sector what a person must learn in order to legally offer medical advice via licensing of doctors, where he must learn it via licensing of medical schools, what chemical compounds can be legally consumed, how to test drugs, how the medical insurance industry should work, and countless other gigantic bodies of knowledge/information are dictated by monopolistic competition-less bureaucracies like the American Medical Association (AMA), the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous others. By comparison, the Information Technology sector has very few government regulations so competition motivates the creation and spread of superior information at breakneck speed and is obviously transforming our world right before our eyes. Teenagers can work at Google/Microsoft/Amazon and write the software that keeps planes in the sky or people alive via software in medical equipment, yet there is no American Association of Computer Programmers dictating what or where such knowledge can be obtained similar to how the government via the AMA regulates/monopolizes/paralyzes the medical sector via the licensing of doctors, medical schools, insurance sector, etc. There is no government monopolistic bureaucracy ensuring the proper functioning of the software that runs PCs, smart-phones, the Internet, or ensuring the lack of malware or viruses in software. Freedom and competition in the Software Development industry is even quickly evolving culture. It is increasingly seen as uncool and backward to have a traditional degree, where one wastes thousands of dollars and time physically attending gigantic temple-like universities, inefficiently ("professors" instead of popular online videos you can pause/rewind) "learning" things that have nothing (English 101, etc.) to do with being a productive software/web/IT professional. Thanks to this lack of monopolistic centralized decision making/regulating/paralyzing, education in the Software Development/IT world is astounding. At places like www.freecodecamp.org thousands of people are going from 0 experience to highly-paid computer programmers in just a few months for free. IT companies who reach a large enough size ultimately due to the great services they provide, and therefore the useful/profitable knowledge they contain, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many others, go about creating their own competing educational institutions which train and test people using their products and technologies which are solving real problems and have been shaped by years of fierce competition/innovation. There are over 2.1 million individuals worldwide who have become Microsoft Certified Professionals(MCPs) by studying for and passing exams created by Microsoft. These exams change frequently to reflect the never-ending cycle of knowledge generation that exists in this freer and less regulated sector of the economy. Economic ignorance leads many to believe that since one has to be seemingly more careful with medicine, such monopolistic regulatory oversight is somehow necessary. This is irrelevant, if it is superior information that is needed, which includes figuring out how careful to be, freedom and competition is the best way to discover it, period. My guess is that if the healthcare sector, or better yet, the entire world-wide economy was as deregulated/free/competitive as the Software/IT sector, in a few months the cost of healthcare would drop by at least 80%, the rate of innovation and prosperity would skyrocket and I would guess that people who as of today have 10 years left to live might be able to beat dying of old age.  Only the truly economically woke can easily accept the feasibility of this statement. But human flight is impossible obviously. 

In this image we can easily see how the less regulated a sector is the smoother competitive knowledge discovery functions and thus the quicker cost-cutting ideas and innovations spread leading to continuously lower prices and better products in things like electronics and software, but higher prices in the more regulated/paralyzed sectors like healthcare and hospitals.

Thus we can see that Freedom is "The Ultimate Algorithm", it discovers the information that orders civilization, it civilizes our morals, is also indispensable for discovering the TRUTH and is the very opposite of coercion and tyranny.

On to a few important concepts relating to wealth and money.

Whenever a person works he produces his labor and whatever wealth it creates thus increasing the economic pie. If you are a freelancer you produce a product/service/wealth and trade it directly with society (customers) for money, and then trade the money back with society for the wealth you consume. If you work for a company, you produce your labor and trade it for money with your “employer” who combines it with the labor of others to produce a product/service/wealth which is then traded with society for the money from which your paycheck comes. Whether you are a freelancer, employee, or company, what is commonly referred to as sales revenue (your paycheck), is an estimate of the total amount of wealth produced. Costs, like employee wages which will be used by them to consume wealth(food,energy,etc.), are an estimate of how much wealth is consumed from the economic pie. And profits, which are the difference between sales revenue (production) and costs (consumption) are an estimate of by how much additional wealth the economic pie has grown. Again, a profitable order is an order (cell/person/company) that produces more than it consumes and is therefore self-sustaining/alive. The global economy or ‘Social Organism’ is really a vast collection of orders/people/companies that are constantly trading with each other, nourishing each other, each trade taking each participant/order from an inferior to a superior state of well-being from its own perspective, otherwise the trade would not occur. When Carl trades a dollar for a hamburger he values the hamburger more than the dollar and the restaurant values the dollar more than the hamburger so the action of trading takes place, which like all action which is not coerced, takes each participant from an inferior to superior state of wellbeing. 

The more a person produces, the more he can consume. The wealthier a person/company/order is, the more this entity has previously produced and exchanged for all this money/wealth. Bill Gates is one of the world’s richest men because the social order he helped shape and successfully managed, Microsoft, has been one of the most productive in the world. We know this is the case because billions of human beings traded their money/wealth for its products/services.

Now, very important!

0. The production of wealth requires the consumption of wealth. For example, if 10,000 men are to spend 2 years producing an airplane factory, they must consume/use the concrete/materials/food/energy/transportation/shelter/wealth that they (as well as their dependents/family) need while they produce the factory. In other words, there can be no production if there does not already exist enough wealth that can be consumed while production takes place.

1. More money does not equal more wealth. Imagine if everyone in the world suddenly had an extra billion dollars. Would this make society wealthier? No. The amount of REAL wealth(goods/services) has not increased by a single toothpick. It would actually lead to less wealth since many people wound stop working/producing seeing their new-found fortune. Would the 10,000 men above be able to produce the factory if instead of having real wealth to use/consume had to consume pieces of paper with dead presidents on them? Of course not.

2. More money just leads to higher prices.  If 10 people in an island each have ten dollars so there is a total of $100, can anything sell for $200? Of course not, because even if they all combine their money there would still not be enough for the transaction to take place. What if each person has 1 million so there are now 10 million in total. Can something now sell for $200 or $1 million? Of course. So for prices to go up there has to be more money. And who creates the money that allows this, the governments via their central banks like the Fed in the USA. Creating more money just means that there is more money per existing unit of real wealth, which just means higher prices.

3. The creation of money by governments is just a hidden tax that transfers wealth from savers and society at large to the people who get the newly created money. For example, Let's say you have saved $1,000 which can buy you 1,000 items at $1/each. The government via Fed and a convoluted process eventually creates billions of dollars which are given to finance the newly-created Space Force military personnel so they can trade them for the wealth they need to consume/live and because of this money-creation prices go up 50% so each item is now $1.50 and your saved $1,000 can only buy you 666 instead of 1,000 items. The additional 334 items/wealth that you and others who find themselves in a similar situation where their savings now buy them less than before is the same amount of wealth that was transferred to the Space Force personnel thanks to the government money creation. Again, money is not the same thing as wealth, when governments create money they are simply creating an additional tax or transfer of wealth from savers and the public at large to those who get the money. 


Next, a few words about "prices"

How much wealth had to be consumed in order to produce a gallon of gasoline that sells in Seattle for $3.50? Or a pound of beef that sells in a store in Miami for $5.35? We can’t know for sure, however, we can be fairly certain that it was less than the advertised price which on average must include the costs. The price of any item in the world lets us know that there is an order at that particular place and time that is coordinated by information that can produce the item while consuming less than the advertised price. THAT IS AMAZING! This allow goods to be purchased and combined in a manner that ensures that the combination (like a car) can easily have a price set that properly accounts for the costs/consumption of the whole (car) by just adding the prices of the parts used to produce it (wheels, glass, robotics, labor, etc.), parts which themselves had a price set that included their costs/consumption and so on, each part/input managed/ordered by entrepreneurs with highly specialized time-and-place specific information who are always using profit/loss calculation to ensure they are increasing the economic pie. The concept of ‘private property’ plays a vital role here as well, it is not until things are privately owned, that they are coordinated by brains/CPUs that are incentivized to use or reorder them in the most productive/profitable way possible.



In order to have life, the social order must be coordinated by information that leads to more production than consumption. This information and coordination is IMPOSSIBLE to achieve by governments/’Central Planners’ regardless of the genius of their “experts” or their good intentions. The following simple example suffices to show this. A restaurant in Miami sells a burger for $8. The $8 price provides vital information. Perhaps $1, might be profit, and $7 will be spent in costs, in other words, in the necessary consumption or use of wealth needed to produce the burger, things like equipment, labor and everything employees will consume at home (food, energy) thanks to their paychecks that came from the $7/burger. The businessman discovered 1) that there are enough customers nearby willing to patronize the restaurant at the $8/burger price thus providing a superior alternative to society and he also discovered 2) how to reorder $7 worth of stuff(labor/supplies/etc.) to produce the burger. If he sets prices too high, customers will choose other superior competing options, if too low, they might not cover costs and cause the business to consume more than it produces leading to an overall shrinking of the economic pie and thus go out of business. Communism can’t work because only businessmen dispersed throughout society are at the right time and place needed to discover people’s desires(1) and (2) the information needed to properly set prices and thus create a profitable order (one that produces more than it consumes).

We summarize...

We have discussed how private property leads to freedom to trade which turns on economic competition which motivates the creation of superior information and subsequent order as well as shaping our morals. We have discussed production, consumption, economic calculation, the relationship between money and prices, how government money creation is just an additional tax that like all taxes just transfers wealth, the inherent inefficiencies and perverse incentives found in governments and finally the impossibility of Communism. We are now ready to understand how the same economic fallacies which led to the rise of Communism and the Soviet Union are simply repeating themselves.

It could be said that Socialism/Communism is a complex of economic fallacies which was almost bound to happen as the social order morphed itself from the easy-to-understand small farm/towns of the pre-1800s to the bewildering growing complexity of the social order brought about by industrialization, world-wide free-trade/competition/Capitalism. Without an understanding of what has just been discussed, most intellectuals of the 1800s/1900s, with the best of intentions, just believed that a far more prosperous and "just" world could be achieved by central planning. Albert Einstein is perhaps the perfect example of a "genius" who with the best of intentions would use his "reason" to provide what is essentially a recipe for the destruction of civilization via his economically ignorant push for 'central planning'/Socialism. In his 1949 article "Why Socialism?" he writes:

"Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor…I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child." [(Einstein, 1949)](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/)

Numerous disastrous economic fallacies can be found above. "Technological progress" allows us to lower costs so more wealth can be created while consuming less thus growing the economic pie. Technological progress has made it so that on average a single worker in the agricultural sector, thanks to increasingly automated tractors/machinery, can create vast quantities of food and competition between such farmers guarantees that they must innovate and copy each other's innovations and that they must sell their food cheaply/competitively so now the masses have more wealth to spend in other sectors helping them grow, like the IT sector and everything else we now have since we don't have 80% of people working on farms like we did just a few centuries ago. The wealth that no longer sustains a job that has been lost to automation simply goes to sustain some other job, allowing us to easily afford more stuff, the stuff that got automated, plus the new stuff we spend our money/wealth on. Einstein is utterly clueless about the fact that the "accumulation" of wealth by savers and the much vilified rich/capitalists, thanks to the the banking/finance industries, is borrowed by entrepreneurs and spent/consumed sustaining private sector jobs. It is important to realize that, as the great economist Henry Hazlitt writes in his classic “Economics in One Lesson”:

>“ “Saving,” in short, in the modern world, is only another form of spending. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production”,

and that this increase in production has to be at least large enough to pay back the loan with interest. Taxing "the rich" just removes this wealth and the private sector jobs it would otherwise sustain and gives it to government where it is inefficiently consumed while producing little in comparison leading to massive relative losses.

So as painful as it might be to admit for some, if Einstein can be so clueless, we can hardly blame Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Roosevelt and the countless others for the misery they caused. Socialism/Communism/Nazism/'viral economic fallacies' did not spread and destroy much of the 20th century because of a few bad apples or tyrants; it first spread through the minds of well-meaning citizens and intellectuals like Einstein which then gave the future leaders the moral and intellectual justification for their actions. Hayek writes:

"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced." (Hayek F. A., 1973, p. 70)

"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)


It is monumentally important that we see Communism/'Central Planning' and Lenin's Bolshevik Revolution which created the Soviet Union(1922) as an almost inevitable spread of viral self-reinforcing economic fallacies and incentives that were just bound to finally spark in a truly sustainable reaction. It wasn't just the economic fallacies, but a perverse incentive structure too. A young idealistic Russian could worry about how to make a good living in the always-uncertain and competitive private sector, or by joining Lenin and his Bolsheviks he could become a hero to mankind by just forcing farmers to give up their grain to feed a bureaucracy/monopoly of "experts" who would plan a superior order. Sign me up! Again, we must focus on how the ideas lead the slightly smarter apes into either carnage or civilization. As Mises tells us:

"It is ideas that group men into fighting factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that, in the last analysis, turn the scales."

Lenin was a "great leader" who had the "strength" to carry out his vision. An example of one of the orders he was sending to various cities/districts to deal with farmers (kulaks) who were rebelling against the grain requisitions went as follows:

>“Comrades! The kulak uprising in your five districts must be crushed without pity. The interests of the whole revolution demand such actions, for the final struggle with the kulaks has now begun. You must make an example of these people. (1) Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known blood-suckers. (2) Publish their names. (3) Seize all their grain. (4) Single out the hostages per my instructions in yesterday’s telegram. Do all this so that for miles around people see it all. Understand it, tremble, and tell themselves that we are killing the bloodthirsty kulaks and that we will continue to do so. Reply saying you have received and carried out these instructions. Yours, Lenin. P.S. Find tougher people.” (Panne, et al., p. 72)"

The unproductive chaos/tyranny that Lenin was creating inevitably brought a gigantic famine that would claim about 5 million lives in 1921 and 1922. The majestic “The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression” explains:

>“Despite the bad harvest of 1920…All grain stocks, even the seed for the future harvest, had been seized. Numerous peasants had virtually nothing to eat since January 1921. The mortality rate had immediately increased in February. In the space of two to three months, riots and revolts against the regime had effectively stopped in the province of Samara. “Today,” Vavilin explained, “there are no more revolts. We see new phenomena instead: crowds of thousands of starving people gather around the Executive Committee or the Party headquarters of the soviet to wait, for days and days, for the miraculous appearance of the food they need. It is impossible to chase this crowd away, and every day more of them die. They are dropping like flies…I think there must be at least 900,000 starving people in this province.” … “Though perfectly well informed of the inevitable consequences of the requisitioning policy, the government took no steps to combat these predicted effects. On 30 July 1921, while famine gripped a growing number of regions, Lenin and Molotov sent a telegram to all leaders of regional and provincial Party committees asking them to “bolster the mechanisms for food collection…step up the propaganda for the rural population, explaining the economic and political importance of the prompt payment of taxes…put at the disposal of the agencies for the collection of taxes in kind all the authority of the Party, and allow them to use all the disciplinary measures that the state itself would use.”” (Panne, et al., pp. 120-1)

Fortunately other Bolshevik leaders helped Lenin accept relief from international organizations like the Red Cross, the Quakers, and future US President Herbert Hoover’s American Relief Association whose combined efforts fed a whopping 11 million people each day. Lenin’s anti-market thus anti-production and thus anti-life/order government-control-measures where such a disaster that by 1921 Lenin scaled some of it back in what was called the NEP (New Economic Policy). The NEP essentially reintroduced some levels of private property/enterprise, especially for farmers/kulaks, which immediately led to a better functioning of the market process and substantial increases in food production (40% increase for 1921-22). 

Among the numerous things to learn from this and similar disasters is the fact that it is understandably difficult for ideologues like Lenin and his governmental structure to change their minds since not only do they have to admit to error but also realize that they have caused unimaginable suffering. This is just the kind of stuff the slightly smarter apes don't do that often. The incentives are to look the other way, or place the blame elsewhere. Even though Lenin was becoming aware of the chaos he was causing, he understandably had incentives to look for other causes, like saboteurs, the rich/'capitalist exploiters', the religious/church who did not want to relinquish power/authority etc. It was his economic policies that were intensifying the misery, but he would just double-down further intensifying it. Even though plenty of people knew Communism would bring about unimaginable suffering, the rate at which the economic ignorance/fallacies and perverse incentives appealed to the tribalistic smarter apes was much faster than the rate at which proper arguments against it could spread. One could say that the definitive knockout blow that proved the impossibility of central planning did not even exist until Ludwig von Mises wrote his ["Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"](https://mises.org/library/economic-calculation-socialist-commonwealth) in 1920, far away and in a foreign language. Without sound economic arguments which were also brief enough to be somewhat viral much of mankind was doomed. The religious traditions of looking at the world's problems as the result of "good" vs. "evil" did not work with the atheistic Socialists/Communists who thanks to scientific progress would discard religion-based moral arguments, in other words, mankind was stuck in what Mises referred to as "the moral sphere". He writes: "The rigid dogmatism peculiar to religious groups and to Marxism results only in irreconcilable conflict. It condemns beforehand all dissenters as evildoers, it calls into question their good faith, it asks them to surrender unconditionally. No social cooperation is possible where such an attitude prevails." Thus the ideological battle between the atheistic 'central planning by experts' viral fallacies and inherited religious traditions continued, with religion, private property, and thus humanity, suffering immensely. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Soviet Union fell from 29,584 to less than 500. The Soviet Union’s anti-religion purges were equal-opportunity, in 1917 there were over 20,000 Islamic mosques in the Soviet Union, by 1935 there would be less than 60. Thousands of priests would stick to their faith and quickly be shot. The atheistic nature of the Soviet Union obviously played a role in making it so much easier to discard human life and thus tremendously deadlier. 
 
In February 25th 1956 Stalin’s successor Nikita Khrushchev shook the world by admitting that "the Great Terror", a political witch-hunt that Stalin carried out (1936-38) and led to the execution of about 700,000 people had been based on lies/exaggerations/etc. He had to wait till Stalin's death to admit this "mistake", however, it was not till Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 that enough doubt and dissent emerged within the political structure and public in the USSR to finally put an end to the more textbook communist/socialist intellectual error and resulting perverse incentives and relative tyranny that ruled that area since 1918. But the challenge did not end there, how do you get millions of people who have spent generations looking at a single bureaucracy to manage the social order and at least keep them alive to abandon that 'order maker' and trust freedom and competition, especially if you were a mid-to-senior bureaucrat with low-productive skill? Or if you were one of the thousands upon thousands of "educated scientists" whose technical and scientific knowledge was simply not conducive to creating the things that free people, instead Communist bureaucrats, wanted? 

With the above in mind, let us now analyze our current situation, especially within the context of the Coronavirus scare.
