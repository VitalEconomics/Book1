### The utterly clueless Bill Gates and the noble lie

The Coronavirus and much much much that is related is quickly making Bill Gates one of the most polarizing figures in the world. To some he embodies a certain ideal, a genius who is heroically trying to prepare and eventually save mankind from what many feel like will be the coming of some super pandemic. Since the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, it makes perfect sense to be open to the possibility that perhaps a superbug, which in a smaller tribal world might have wiped out a tiny tribe, might now wipe out all of humanity. It is understandable how this mindset would almost inevitably lure an increasing amount of people until 

someone to heroically attempt to prevent such a scenario, and it could very well be the case that Mr. Gates is one of these people, and that an increasing number of World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control ideologues and countless politicians and others would eventually have a mindset that makes taking global coordinated action to prevent suchh a potential disaster from happening. Since such 



Assuming that one is thoroughly convinced that something like this is bound to happen it potentially places Mr. Gates or whoever attempts to desperately do something to prevent it in a situation

I dont fall for the silly right-wing attacks and simpkistic bullshit about Gates being some "power hungry" bad guy and all that simpistic semy-religious good vs evil bullshit.... My guess is Gates really believes he can make the world a betre place by getting mankind to take steps now.. Unfortunately... THis is where the utter economic ignorance comes in... Instead of simply educating and preaching beter capitalism and free market s which increase or ability to improve technology and perhaps prepare agains this in a a 100% easily verifiable and safe way.. He is trying to implement his master plan and thus inevitable already neeeded to coerce mankind to go along with whtever he feels is the solution.. so his problem is that he is totally economically ignorant.. he has 0 idea of how freedom and competition discover things.. He has NEVER mentioned ludwig von mises of F.A. Hayek so he simpkly does not have a fucking clue how the world works... Nuff said
