<h3 id="production-and-consumption">Production and Consumption</h3>
<p>Whenever a person works he produces his labor and whatever wealth it creates thus increasing the economic pie. If you are a freelancer you produce a product/service/wealth and trade it directly with society (customers) for money, and then trade the money back with society for the wealth you consume. If you work for a company, you produce your labor and trade it for money with your “employer” who combines it with the labor of others to produce a product/service/wealth which is then traded with society for the money from which your paycheck comes. Whether you are a freelancer, employee, or company, what is commonly referred to as sales revenue (your paycheck), is an estimate of the total amount of wealth produced. Costs, like employee wages which will be used by them to consume wealth(food,energy,etc.), are an estimate of how much wealth is consumed from the economic pie. And profits, which are the difference between sales revenue (production) and costs (consumption) are an estimate of by how much additional wealth the economic pie has grown. Again, a profitable order is an order (cell/person/company) that produces more than it consumes and is therefore self-sustaining/alive. The global economy or ‘Social Organism’ is really a vast collection of orders/people/companies that are constantly trading with each other, nourishing each other, each trade taking each participant/order from an inferior to a superior state of well-being from its own perspective, otherwise the trade would not occur. When Carl trades a dollar for a hamburger he values the hamburger more than the dollar and the restaurant values the dollar more than the hamburger so the action of trading takes place, which like all action which is not coerced, takes each participant from an inferior to superior state of wellbeing.</p>
<p>If a teenager uses a tree-trimmer to produce one mowed lawn valued at $50 in 10 hours, his ‘rate of production’ is $50 / 10 hours = $5/hour. If next month he uses a riding lawn mower and mows the same lawn in 1 hour, he has increased his ‘rate of production’ 10-fold to $50/hour. Profit/loss calculation motivates and enables all orders to guide their actions in the most profitable and thus pie-increasing way, and, very importantly, it also prevents orders from consuming more than what they produce. The wealthier a person/company/order is, the more this order has produced and exchanged for all this money/wealth. Bill Gates is one of the world’s richest men because the social order he helped shape and successfully managed, Microsoft, has been one of the most productive in the world. We know this is the case because billions of human beings traded their money/wealth for its products/services.</p>
<p>The production of wealth requires the consumption of wealth. For example, if 10,000 men are to spend 2 years producing an airplane factory, they must consume/use the concrete/materials/food/energy/transportation/shelter/wealth that they (as well as their dependents/family) need while they produce the factory. In other words, there can be no production if there does not already exist enough wealth that can be consumed while production takes place.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>More money does not equal more wealth. Imagine if everyone in the world suddenly had an extra billion dollars. Would this make society wealthier? No. The amount of REAL wealth(goods/services) has not increased by a single toothpick. It would actually lead to less wealth since many people wound stop working/producing seeing their new-found fortune. Would the 10,000 men above be able to produce the factory if instead of having real wealth to use/consume had to consume pieces of paper with dead presidents on them? Of course not.</p>
<p>More money leads to and enables higher prices. For example, if there are 1,000 people in an island (BlueIsle) and each has $100 for a total of $100,000 in the island, can anything sell for $200,000? Of course not, even if they all combined their money such a transaction could not happen because there isn’t enough money, but what if each person had $500 so that there is now a total of $500,000? Then yes obviously, prices could go up to $500,000. So for general prices to go up there HAS to be more money. And who creates the money and is ultimately responsible for a general increase in prices? Generally speaking, today all money is created by governments via their central banks (Federal Reserve in USA) and they are thus responsible for the price increases. Let’s say you print yourself 1,000 trillion dollars and start offering people in the USA’s West coast ridiculous amounts of money for their goods/property/wealth. You buy all the wealth in California, Washington, Oregon, etc. As this is happening Americans are growing richer in terms of money but poorer in terms of what really matters, homes/property/wealth. At some point you make it to Florida, by this time it will be packed with about 300 million Americans and perhaps the 1,000 trillion dollars or more you kept offering people. The price of wealth tends to be the amount of money that is offered in exchange for it given all the other things the money could be traded for. With so much money and so little wealth left, the price of everything would be astronomical and people would be much poorer given that you are the one that possesses most of the wealth in the country. Assuming the total amount of money remains stable, if the economy/wealth is expanding, which can only happen if the rate at which goods/services/wealth is produced is faster than the rate at which it is consumed, we expect general prices to go DOWN because the money will sort of get divided among more goods/wealth so less money per item/wealth means a lower price. If the amount of wealth remains stable or grows slower than the amount/supply of money, then we have more money per item, thus higher prices.</p>
<p>Let’s go over a final and very important example. Keep your eye on how much wealth is being produced and consumed, and the relationship between the quantity of money, wealth, and thus prices. Let’s say Alan prints himself another $100,000 which is enough to hire half the people in BlueIsle for 3 months while they build him a small castle. Alan thinks this is a great idea, he is paying some people more than what they were making before, there were also a few unemployed or unmotivated-to-work people before but he is offering enough money to get everyone working thus achieving “full-employment”. Prior to trading their labor for Alan’s paper/money, people were producing stuff that they either wanted/needed to consume themselves or could be sold/traded to others who obviously wanted/needed to consume them, they were producing “socially desired” or “order/life creating/sustaining” stuff like oranges/apples/hair-cuts/blankets/baskets/etc. The day half the population begins working on Alan’s castle, the island’s economic pie begins to lose half its “socially desired” stuff/wealth since half the population is no longer creating it, and begins increasing the amount of rocks, ladders, and other things for Alan’s castle. These things, are NOT “socially desired” or “order creating/sustaining” wealth as judged/calculated by the inhabitants. Since the existing $100,000 will be distributed over half as many socially-desired-goods, this would eventually motivate their prices to about double. However, since Alan is further doubling the money supply as he pays people using his newly printed $100,000, on the last days of castle-building, when half the population is still working on his castle and they have also received most of the new $100,000, prices would have nearly doubled once again making them about 4 times higher than they were before Alan came up with his idea. It should be easy to see that Alan has reordered society in an inferior way. Everyone is “working” and making more money than before, but the unavoidable reality that they are ordered in a less productive way reflects itself in the much higher prices and smaller amount of wealth on average that each can consume. Ideally people now “lose their jobs”, and instead of working on the easily identifiable yet disastrous plan laid out by Alan, for a few days there appears to be “chaos” as people discover superior plans and likely transition to their old trades/jobs thus once again reordering society on a far, far more productive way. However, they are <strong>economically ignorant</strong>, so they tell Alan “Can you hire us again to make the castle bigger? You pay us more than what we used to make before. You are about to create massive unemployment”. Alan thinks to himself “Gosh! It is a good thing that by creating money I am preventing massive unemployment and chaos. Obviously I must keep providing ‘liquidity’!” So the relative suffering continues. Had Alan been a bad king, who instead of creating money to acquire the necessary wealth to create his castle, simply taxed people at a 50% rate, the people’s living standard would have suffered similarly, but they would have easily understood the fact that their wealth was taken from them for the creation of things they didn’t want or benefit from for a hopefully more obvious massive loss.</p>
<p>The higher prices that creating money brings about can be seen as a hidden tax on the public whose money/savings can now buy them less wealth than before. If you have $100 saved and can buy 100 hamburgers for $1 each and because of inflation their price is now $2 so you can only buy 50, you have essentially been taxed an additional 50% thus losing half of your wealth. Regardless of the amount of money, at any given time there exists a certain amount of wealth owned/control by certain individuals. The moment governments create money and give it to some entity they are allowing that entity to trade it for wealth and thus consume wealth without having previously increased production for a net loss/transfer from society. The creation of money by governments just transfers wealth from the public/savers to those who get the money.</p>
<h3 id="trade-money-and-the-division-of-labor-and-information">Trade, Money and the Division of Labor and Information</h3>
<p>Trade and money led to the “division of labor and information” which allowed the social order to efficiently compartmentalize information in only the brains that needed it and also accumulate a virtually limitless amount of information with which to continuously restructure itself in increasingly more productive/advanced ways. For example, Mark’s brain contains knowledge of how to get coconuts and process them to create pastries. Tom’s brain contains knowledge of how to find the best vines and weave them together to make baskets. Jim’s of where to find rocks which when split can create sharp knives and how to sharpen them. When Mark trades his pastries for Tom’s baskets and Jim’s knives he is a benefactor of all the knowledge needed to creating those items yet he only had to know how to make his pastries. Unlike the tribal social order where knowledge is inefficiently repeated across every brain, trade allows for information to be efficiently stored fewer times freeing up more brains to contain more information. We can envision 1,000 men producing and trading 1,000 different types of items requiring 1,000 times more information which without trade and the ‘division of information’ that it enables would have been impossible to achieve in a tribal society. Also, when Mark trades his pastries for the baskets and knives he can now make less trips to gather coconuts by using the baskets and process them faster by using the knives and thus increase his ‘rate of production’ from 2 to 10 pastries per day. The pastry-making process has become more productive and also more complex because it was enabled by basket and knife making knowledge. We now have a never-ending cycle of increased ‘rate of production’ and complexity -&gt; population growth (more brains) -&gt; increased ‘rate of production’ and complexity -&gt; more brains -&gt; … leading to where we are today with nearly 8 billion people and the inability to fully trace the knowledge that enabled the creation of anything. In Hayek’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the greater density of population, leading to the discovery of opportunities for specialisation, or division of labour, led to yet further increases of population and per capita income that made possible another increase in the population. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YQLYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22the+greater+density+of+population,+leading+to+the+discovery+of+opportunities%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OdrrCyyGT3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RrY6L_hQm8BCBOad08o-du-kPtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3wOfc4q_pAhUxFjQIHe5VBigQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20greater%20density%20of%20population%2C%20leading%20to%20the%20discovery%20of%20opportunities%22&amp;f=false">And so on."</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a web-designer can trade his services which are dependent on web-design information that resides in his brain for money, and then trade the money for any of the billions of products/services that exist in the world and are likewise dependent on information spread throughout the world. The websites he creates are also enabled by all the information that enabled the “factors of production” he used to create them, like his computer, monitor, keyboard, software, electricity, the Internet, etc., which themselves are enabled by all the information that enabled their “factors of production” like the computer’s memory, processor, and so on. Everything that is produced today is the result of an interdependence of information that spans millions of minds, not just in the present, but in the past as well, because wealth that is currently being produced/consumed is dependent on tools/‘factors of production’/information provided further in the past. When he upgrades to a better computer, the information that enabled these improvements also contributes to/enables the improvement of his website production process. Without money how would a heart surgeon trade his costly services for toothpicks? Without trade and money, this “division of labor and information” as well as the inter-temporal cooperation/interlocking/stacking of information just described, and the ability to do profit/loss calculation to ensure that each order guides its actions in a manner that it produces more than it consumes, would not exist and neither would our social order which depends on it.</p>
<h3 id="creation-and-spread-of-information-via-economic-competition">Creation and Spread of Information via Economic Competition</h3>
<p>In the ‘Social Organism’ new/superior information arises and spreads largely thanks to economic competition. Economic competition motivates the social order’s billions of minds/CPUs to constantly innovate and copy each other’s innovations thus continuously generating and spreading superior information, inadvertently reordering society as fast as humanly possible/profitable, turning it into a sort of super-computer which coordinates the transformation of matter into socioeconomic order/life. For example, all private sector orders/companies like BMW, Ford, and Toyota are constantly innovating and copying each other’s innovations like power door-locks/windows and more recently electric vehicles thus continuously creating/spreading superior information and subsequent order. Why do they do this? Because people/orders have the freedom to trade their life/order-sustaining wealth with the better informed auto-manufacturers/competitors. This in turn motivates all competitors/orders to learn/copy each other lest they not get enough revenue/wealth with which to pay their employees a competitive wage so they leave to join the better informed and thus more productive/efficient orders. This wonderful automatic mechanism is “turned on” or “emerges” from the simple concept, or better said, tradition of ‘private property’. Private property gives everyone in our role as consumers the ‘freedom to trade’ our life/order-sustaining wealth for what we calculate/think is best. This ‘freedom to trade/choose’ in turn motivates everyone, in our role as producers, to discover how to order ourselves in a manner that produces something society/customers value (our labor, a product/service), which we do by, once again, innovating and/or copying/learning existing ideas/information, in other words, by competing in the economic sense. Most of us simply choose to produce and then trade our labor with a company/order that knows how to further incorporate our labor in a more competitive/profitable way.</p>
<p>A mind/CPU anywhere in the planet that comes up with an improvement will benefit everyone in the world if they are free to trade for his product/service which will also motivate all competitors in the world to likewise improve their actions/order. So we can see how just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in the world due to global competition, so does having the freedom to trade with everyone in the world allows the best ideas to compete/spread globally thus ensuring the best possible global order. As cost-cutting ideas emerge and inevitably spread via competition leading prices to continuously fall, new profitable ideas easily arise and once again spread via competition in an endless cycle of knowledge generation/innovation. For example, computers were once very expensive, but once the price of making them came down enough, people easily realized that every home could have them, which gave birth to our computerized world and the Internet and all the great things that flow from it. The more wealth is produced, the more wealth has to be offered in exchange for labor as companies/orders compete against each other for the labor they need which helps explain why the economic pie grows for everyone. For example, imagine that after a shipwreck you end up in an island where everyone has a machine that can turn dirt into food. Tom wants your labor to build a home, Mark, to build a boat, and Gina to plant a garden. Competition will motivate them to offer you all the food you want and more.</p>
<h3 id="prices-and-the-impossibility-of-central-planningsocialismcommunism">Prices and the Impossibility of ‘Central Planning’/Socialism/Communism</h3>
<p>How much wealth had to be consumed in order to produce a gallon of gasoline that sells in Seattle for $3.50? Or a pound of beef that sells in a store in London for $5.35? We can’t know for sure, however, we can be fairly certain that it was less than the advertised price which on average must include the costs. The price of any item in the world lets us know that there is an order at that particular place and time that is coordinated by information that can produce the item while consuming less than the advertised price. THAT IS AMAZING! This allow goods to be purchased and combined in a manner that ensures that the combination (like a car) can easily have a price set that properly accounts for the costs/consumption of the whole (car) by just adding the prices of the parts used to produce it (wheels, glass, robotics, labor, etc.), parts which themselves had a price set that included their costs/consumption and so on, each part/input managed/ordered by entrepreneurs with highly specialized time-and-place specific information who are always using profit/loss calculation to ensure they are increasing the economic pie. The concept/tradition of ‘private property’ plays a vital role here as well, it is not until things are privately owned, that they are controlled/coordinated by brains/CPUs that are incentivized to use/reorder/coordinate them in the most productive/profitable way possible.</p>
<p>The information needed to create/coordinate the social order, like whether to produce cars, or buildings, or pizzas, where to do so, what prices to set, and most importantly, how to produce them in a manner that more wealth is produced than consumed, is information that can only be created by free people dispersed throughout the world thus rendering central planning ideologies like Socialism/Communism IMPOSSIBLE regardless of the good intentions of their members or their intelligence. For example, a Cuban restaurant in Miami Beach sells a picadillo dish (ground beef, plantains, rice) for $8. Perhaps $1 might be profit, and $7 will be spent in costs, in other words, in the necessary consumption of wealth needed to produce the meal/wealth, things like equipment/electricity/food, and everything employees and their families will consume at home (food, energy) thanks to their paychecks that came from the $7/meal. The businessman discovered 1) that there are enough customers nearby willing to patronize the restaurant at the $8/meal price which necessitates taking into account customer’s already existing local competitive options thus providing an improvement in society, and 2) how to reorder $7 worth of stuff(labor/supplies/etc.) to produce the meal. If he sets prices too high, customers will choose other superior existing competing options. If he sets prices too low, he won’t cover costs and cause more consumption than production thus shrinking the economic pie. These are two vital things that are impossible for a central planning body to discover and helps explain why every time Communism has been attempted the result has been a much faster rate of consumption than production and eventual famine/starvation/chaos/death.</p>
<p>Since prices that properly estimate costs/consumption can only be set by free entrepreneurs, when the government (central planners) attempts to set them via “price controls” it warps the socioeconomic order in inferior ways. For example, if the free-market price of a gallon of milk is $2.30 in a particular store in Miami which profits 0.30 per gallon (costs = $2.00) and the government mandates the price to be $1.99, then the business is consuming more wealth ($2.00) than what it gets ($1.99) and will eventually go bankrupt causing less milk to be produced leading to shortages. Even if the government sets the price to, say $2.15, so that the business can still profit, it will still lead to eventual shortages for the following reasons. Under normal circumstances the rate of profit tends to be equal/uniform across all sectors/businesses, if higher-than-average profits are being made in say auto-manufacturing, factors of production like labor, materials, real-estate are withdrawn from other less profitable sectors which reduces production/competition in them causing profits to go up in those sectors, while simultaneously increasing production/competition in the auto-manufacturing sector causing the initial higher-than-average rate of profit to go down towards average levels. So by making profits in milk production lower than the average it still has the effect of decreasing, albeit less drastically, milk production which is the opposite of what the economically ignorant masses and politicians want.</p>
<p>It is important to envision the socioeconomic order as it really exists as if looked at from high above. Envision people coming together/apart as companies/orders emerge and dissolve in ever-changing conditions. Superior information arising and rippling/restructuring the social order thanks to competition. As orders get more productive they lure other people to ‘trade-with’/‘join-them’ by offering more money/wealth for their labor relative to other companies/orders, eventually causing the least productive orders to sort of dissolve as their ‘factors of production’ like labor, buildings, etc. are bid away to be parts of more productive plans/orders. A sort of swarm intelligence emerges as the all-pervasive public quickly nourishes the growth and spread or superior orders/companies/information, inadvertently expanding the worldwide “division of labor and information” as entire neighborhoods/cities morph themselves in specialized ways as complementary pieces of information/orders segregate themselves in distinct geographical locations like the software industry in Silicon Valley, California and manufacturing in Guangdong, southern China. As Mises reminds us “The division of labour is a fundamental principle of all forms of life.” The division of labor is a pattern/way which natural selection rediscovers to enable smaller units/orders to efficiently compartmentalize labor/information as they contribute-to (and are nourished-by) a larger organism they become parts of(Organelles -&gt; Cells -&gt; Organs -&gt; Humans -&gt; Social Organism).</p>
<h3 id="morals-as-superior-information">Morals as Superior Information</h3>
<p>We should quickly add that morals are simply ways of acting, they are knowledge which also emerges and spreads via economic competition. Companies/orders that hire/nourish/‘trade with’ lazy, disrespectful, or corrupt people will be less competitive and be inevitably pressured/selected to hire people with better morals which in turn forces everyone to be respectful and hardworking regardless of race, sex, etc. Similarly, it is hard-working, tolerant, courteous people who thanks to competition inevitably force everyone else to be likewise. As Hayek tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Competition is, after all, always a process in which a small number makes it necessary for larger numbers to do what they do not like, be it to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work which without competition would not be needed.” <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=malYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA77&amp;lpg=RA2-PA77&amp;dq=%22continuous+application,+or+regularity+to+their+work+which+without+competition+would+not+be+needed%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kU2cMHmKYQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U30vW96Pca8EGx2LO5qTHNN9P8FNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwinl4zg4PDoAhUChHIEHWifC9IQ6AEwAHoECAsQKQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22continuous%20application%2C%20or%20regularity%20to%20their%20work%20which%20without%20competition%20would%20not%20be%20needed%22&amp;f=false">(Hayek “Law, Legislation and Liberty, Volume 3: The Political Order of a Free People” 1981, p. 77)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As millions of Italians, Britons, Germans and others from all over the world came to America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from ‘private property’ and thus individual liberty/freedom which stripped these people of their otherwise nationalistic/ethnocentric/tribalistic identities and evolved what came to be seen as the classic American character/ethos of wanting to be seen as a reputable/honest businessman/professional who treats everyone with respect and wears a business suit as opposed to older religious/ethnocentric dress. So not only does ‘private property’ “turn on” or leads to economic competition and other aspects of the market process and resulting social order/civilization, it also evolves our culture/identity to be ideally suited for participation in the ‘Social Organism’.</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-paralysis">Regulatory Paralysis</h3>
<p>With our focus on how information arises and coordinates life/order, we can see that a government regulation is essentially a “way” of doing things, it is information. But unlike information that arises in the private/competitive sector and is constantly being replaced by superior information due to economic competition, a government regulation is information that arises out of a few brains and is then forced upon the entire social order via the law and can only be changed via a painfully slow monopolistic/bureaucratic apparatus made up of economically ignorant politicians, lawyers, lobbyists and special interest groups who always lack the necessary local time-and-place-knowledge and incentives to discover what is the best way to do something. The more the government regulates, the more it paralyzes competitive knowledge discovery. As government regulations have increased in the health care sector, turning it into a sort of island of paralyzed top-down competition-less/socialist central planning, so have costs. These increased costs have led the sector to grow from consuming just 1.6% of the American economic pie in 1960 to 4.2% in 1980 to a whopping 16% in 2006 and about 18% by 2017. The image below helps explain the regulatory paralysis/bureaucratization of the entire medical sector which is responsible for the skyrocketing costs.</p>
<p><img src="../images/doctors.png" alt="Doctors"
    title="Doctors" width="550" height="400" /></p>
<p>What a person must learn in order to legally offer medical advice via licensing of doctors, where he must learn it via licensing of medical schools, what chemical compounds can be legally consumed, how to test drugs, how the medical insurance industry should work, and countless other gigantic bodies of knowledge/information are dictated by monopolistic competition-less bureaucracies like the American Medical Association (AMA), the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous others. By comparison, the Information Technology sector has very few government regulations so competition motivates the creation and spread of superior information at breakneck speed and is obviously transforming our world right before our eyes. Teenagers can work at Google/Microsoft/Amazon and write the software that keeps planes in the sky or people alive via software in medical equipment, yet there is no American Association of Computer Programmers dictating what or where such knowledge can be obtained similar to how the government via the AMA regulates/monopolizes/paralyzes the medical sector via the licensing of doctors, medical schools, insurance sector, etc. There is no government monopolistic bureaucracy ensuring the proper functioning of the software that runs PCs, smart-phones, the Internet, or ensuring the lack of malware or viruses in software. Freedom and competition in the Software Development industry is even quickly evolving culture. It is increasingly seen as uncool and backward to have a traditional degree, where one wastes thousands of dollars and time physically attending gigantic temple-like universities, inefficiently (“professors” instead of popular online videos you can pause/rewind) “learning” things that have nothing (English 101, etc.) to do with being a productive software/web/IT professional. Thanks to this lack of monopolistic centralized decision making/regulating/paralyzing, education in the Software Development/IT world is astounding. At places like www.freecodecamp.org thousands of people are going from 0 experience to highly-paid computer programmers in just a few months for free. IT companies who reach a large enough size ultimately due to the great services they provide, and therefore the useful/profitable knowledge they contain, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many others, go about creating their own educational institutions which train and test people using their products and technologies which are solving real problems and have been shaped by years of fierce competition. There are over 2.1 million individuals worldwide who have become Microsoft Certified Professionals(MCPs) by studying for and passing exams created by Microsoft. These exams change frequently to reflect the never-ending cycle of knowledge generation that exists in this freer and less regulated sector of the economy. Economic ignorance leads many to believe that since one has to be seemingly more careful with medicine, such monopolistic regulatory oversight is somehow necessary. This is irrelevant, if it is superior knowledge that is needed, which includes figuring out how careful to be, freedom and competition is the best way to discover it, period. If the medical sector, or better yet, the entire world-wide economy was as deregulated and thus as competitive/innovative as the Software/IT sector, the rate of innovation and prosperity would skyrocket and in all likelihood people who as of today have 15 years left to live might be able to beat dying of old age. Only the truly economically woke can easily accept the feasibility of this statement. In graph below one can see how the more regulated a sector is (Hospital Services) the more expensive/consumptive it becomes.</p>
<p><img src="../images/regulations.png" alt="Regulations"
    title="Regulations" width="550" height="600" /></p>
<p>One of the numerous flaws in how the AMA goes about regulating the world of medicine is in the assumption that medical professionals have to be some of the brightest and most dedicated people around, which it attempts to achieve by making entry into medical school and training such an arduous and ultimately expensive process. But this assumption is false, what cures people, or produces any product or service in today’s world, is not so much hard working bright individuals, it is the tremendous amount of knowledge and cheap technology that the market-process-coordinated world puts at our fingertips. This flaw is not specific to the AMA, it applies to our educational establishments and much of how we look at learning and the role of human intelligence. The market process and resulting world-wide “division of labor and information” is far, far more important than individual intelligence/IQ/effort. For example, Mike knows he can incorporate Tom (who has down syndrome) into his landscaping company by having him perform simple tasks in a manner that increases the company’s ‘rate of production/revenue’ in terms of landscaping services by an additional $4/hour ($640/month). Mike trades $3/hour ($480/month) for Tom’s labor to make a 1/hour (160/month) profit, and after just 10 hours of labor/production and trade, Tom can produce a mindbogglingly complex tablet by trading his $30 for it. Thus it currently takes about 10 hours of labor for a low-IQ person to produce something that was impossible to create just 20 years ago. “But he didn’t really create the tablet!” thinks the economically ignorant. But guess what? The economically woke knows the neither did the company that “manufactured it”. Did such a company create the tablet’s CPU? Or the memory/camera/touchscreen/battery/plastic? Or any of the machinery/tools required to produce the aforementioned components? Of course not. The “manufacturer”, just like Tom, mostly traded and added a relatively minuscule amount of new information compared to what it already got from the “Social Organism” and its world-wide division of labor/information that has been evolving for thousands of years. Due to massive economic ignorance, Tom’s truly astounding rate of production is impossible to achieve because it is either illegal for someone to trade their labor/production for a rate lower than the minimum of $12/hour (i.e. California), or because the legal expenses related to paying someone less than the minimum make it unprofitable to do so. Minimum wage laws are regulations which essentially outlaw all production that does not occur faster than the legally mandated minimum and hurt the least productive members of society who need wealth the most. Elderly who due to old age eventually produce at a slower rate, teenagers, etc.</p>
<p>Government regulations, which again, are knowledge or information which is imposed on the social order by force, not only paralyze the superior competitive knowledge discovery that would otherwise exist and enable the growth of paralyzing/inefficient bureaucracies, they also allow BAD ideas to be much harder to change. We only have to remind ourselves of the Catholic Church’s regulation of speech/thought which led to the persecution of thinkers like Galileo Galilei and thus the general retardation of scientific progress to various degrees. Bad ideas, like Socialism/Communism must have intellectual persecution in order to prevent criticism or ideological competition. So once again we must highlight that freedom, is not only indispensable for the competitive discovery of innovations, but also for discovering the TRUTH.</p>
<h3 id="governmentpublic-sector-is-an-inefficient-monopoly">Government/‘Public Sector’ is an Inefficient Monopoly</h3>
<p>Governmental/‘public sector’ orders, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life/order-sustaining wealth through taxes/compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives/pressures which motivate/force private sector orders to be efficient/innovative/hard-working. This helps one further understand how Communism, which abolishes competing orders and replaces them with a single competition-less monopolistic bureaucracy, leads to a massive lack of production/innovation and eventually socioeconomic chaos/starvation as the economic pie continuously shrinks as has happened in every country that consciously attempts Communism/Socialism or inadvertently drifts in that direction as their governments get bigger and bigger (USA/Word). Central plans, of course, can’t work if people are free to not go along with them — so they inevitably require compulsion/slavery. For example, it is a criminal act in Communist countries to start a business, in other words, to attempt a superior restructuring of society. It is also a criminal act everywhere to not pay taxes that sustain public sector bureaucracies like “public education” so there is little incentive or wealth to sustain other, more desirable/superior competitors. For example, the NYC public(monopolistic) school bureaucracy consumes about $29,000 per year to “educate” a K-12 student. Refusing to pay a single dollar that goes to this bureaucracy is a criminal act. The image below is another one of our most powerful memes for explaining the difference between competitive/private orders(South Korea) and monopolistic/government orders (North Korea). Again, keep your eye on how information arises/spreads and continuously restructures the social order. Taxes just transfer wealth from the private sector which is profitably ordered thus constantly increasing the economic pie/life/order to monopolistic governments which mostly consume such wealth depressing economic growth/order/life.</p>

<p>In his essay <a href="https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-essay-over-legislation/">“Over-Legislation” Herbert Spencer</a> beautifully comments on the differences between governmental(law-made) orders and private/competitive ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How invariably officialism becomes corrupt every one knows. Exposed to no such antiseptic as free competition — not dependent for existence, as private unendowed organizations are, upon the maintenance of a vigorous vitality; all law-made agencies fall into an inert, over-fed state, from which to disease is a short step. Salaries flow in irrespective of the activity with which duty is performed; continue after duty wholly ceases; becomes rich prizes for the idle well born; and prompt to perjury, to bribery, to simony. … Officialism is habitually slow. When non-governmental agencies are dilatory, the public has its remedy: it ceases to employ them, and soon finds quicker ones. Under this discipline all private bodies are taught promptness. But for delays in State-departments there is no such easy cure. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider first how immediately every private enterprise is dependent upon the need for it; and how impossible it is for it to continue if there be no need. Daily are new trades and new companies established. If they subserve some existing public want, they take root and grow. If they do not, they die of inanition. It needs no act of Parliament, to put them down. As with all natural organizations, if there is no function to them, no nutrient comes to them, and they dwindle away. Moreover, not only do the new agencies disappear if they are superfluous, but the old ones cease to be when they have done their work. Unlike law-made instrumentalities…these private instrumentalities dissolve when they become needless. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, officialism is stupid. Under the natural course of things each citizen tends towards his fittest function. Those who are competent to the kind of work they undertake, succeed, and, in the average of cases, are advanced in proportion to their efficiency; while the incompetent, society soon finds out, ceases to employ, forces to try something easier, and eventually turns to use. But it is quite otherwise in State-organizations. Here, as everyone knows, birth, age, back-stairs intrigue, and sycophancy, determine the selections, rather than merit. The “fool of the family” readily finds a place in the Church, if “the family” have good connections. A youth, too ill-educated for any active profession, does very well for an officer in the Army. Gray hair or a title, is a far better guarantee of naval promotion than genius is. Nay, indeed, the man of capacity often finds that, in government offices, superiority is a hindrance — that his chiefs hate to be pestered with his proposed improvements, and are offended by his implied criticism. Not only, therefore, is legislative machinery complex, but it is made of inferior materials.</p>

<h3 id="the-benefits-of-immigration">The benefits of immigration</h3>
<p>The free migration of people allows them to quickly become parts of and expand the most productive orders thus vastly increasing production. A person in Africa is stuck in an unproductive order which lacks good laws (respect for private property of course), roads, advanced tools/factories, large groups of already-highly-educated and productive minds/order so his production might be $5 per day. By just moving to a more advanced/productive country/area like the USA, even without knowing English, he can do many jobs managed/aided by a bilingual English speaker and easily increase his rate of production to say $7/hour or $56/day, an 11-fold increase in his rate of production, benefiting his life tremendously and that of existing American/world producers because they now have additional customers that can actually afford their products instead of poor Africans that can’t. In countries like China, every day thousands of relatively unproductive farmers who are producing wealth at a rate of say $4/day are moving to cities to join/work-with/use factories which might triple their rate of production to say $12/day. Similarly, one of the reasons why the USA has been far more productive than the similarly sized Europe is because people have had the freedom to easily move to the areas/companies that are more productive and there have been no internal tariffs and other impediments to free-trade. When countries allow foreign investment, they make it profitable for wealth to be shipped to poor countries to create the tools/factories/order that can increase the productivity of workers, but it is even better when the workers have the freedom to quickly move to and incorporate themselves with the already existing more productive order.</p>
