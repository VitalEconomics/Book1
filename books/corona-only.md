Just like something as orderly and complex as the human body will suffer an internal chaos which makes it impossible to resuscitate if it goes without oxygen for just a few minutes, the Coronavirus-related economic policies will quickly lead to a socioeconomic chaos/riots which will likewise make it impossible for the world-wide economy, or what 19th century British philosopher Herbert Spencer so cleverly referred to as "The Social Organism", to restart itself. 




The Coronavirus-related economic shutdown is on its way to becoming another calamity similar to WWI/II or even worse. This calamity is ultimately based on similar economic fallacies to those which led to Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Communist revolution in 1918 which led to a famine in 1921 that claimed over 5 million lives, and was later followed up with 70+ years of various unproductive and totalitarian Communist regimes around the world. The economic paralysis/breakdown which took Lenin a few years to accomplish as his misguided policies did their inevitable damage, has been accomplished by various economically clueless governments  





Just like something as orderly and complex as the human body will die if it goes without oxygen for just a few minutes, I believe that the current Coronavirus-related economic policies will lead to a cascade of disastrous economic policies which will create a Mad-Max-type scenario which will obviously mean the destruction of civilization.
