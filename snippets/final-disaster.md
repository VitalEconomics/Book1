### Ideas Leading to the Final Disaster: Coronavirus, WWIII


Let us now discuss the disastrous fallacies which are increasingly dominating the thinking of the fellow hordes of slightly smarter apes and their leaders/"experts" which will soon lead to the destruction of civilization if those of us who have had the miraculous luck of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/friends fail in spreading their wisdom. The root of all of our problems is obviously economic ignorance which eventually manifests itself in various socioeconomic "diseases"/wars/lockdowns and oppression needed to get everyone to go along with "the plan" that will fix the problems/Coronavirus/etc. This is similar to how our faulty diets eventually cause imbalances in the body that manifest themselves in various physical diseases. 

The Coronavirus scare is simply another manifestation of the economic ignorance which led to the Bolshevik revolution but carried out in slightly different circumstances. In addition to all the fallacies which motivated Lenin which are still tremendously popular(democratic socialism, anti-capitalism), we now have some little-understood pathogen/virus which is motivating a complete paralysis of production which in a pure economic/real sense is not much different than the paralysis of production Lenin caused and will inevitably bring about a similar chaos. However, due to the lack of efficient and quick communication/mobilization in Russia during Lenin's time(1918), it took him a couple of years for the economic damage to reach famine proportions. Things are different this time, within a few short weeks, a significant portion of the world-wide population has been ignorantly coerced into paralysis which will bring socioeconomic chaos much faster. The very same cluster of errors and incentives that led to the Bolshevik/USSR disaster are playing themselves out again in much of the world. There is also the usual economic ignorance and tribalism that eventually causes politicians to both increase paralysis of economy as they intervene and also blame other countries as is clearly the case with the USA becoming increasingly hostile towards China with tariffs and desire to "bring back manufacturing" to the USSA thus greatly harming the world-wide division of labor and everyone's standard of living. The Environmentalist mindset and its fallacies which also leads to central planning and the desire/need for some calamity to limit human population also continues to spread. And of course there is the most disastrous fallacy/myth of all, that some kind of world war is what will be needed or inevitable to fix the economy "like it did in WWII", especially as the Coronavirus lockdows and repercussions spread economic chaos and inevitable fingerpointing. 

The perverse incentives that are helping the economic errors spread are astounding, everyone who works for or is highly dependent on the government is motivated to keep the shutdown going because their wealth is not affected by it, it is a sort of vacation for most of them. Public teachers, universities, etc. It is the private sector, which must compete and is dependent on the freedom of people which is being destroyed, but the horde is of course impervious to the fact that it is the private sector that creates most of the wealth which the public sector then gets to coerce/consume. Although the Federal Government will create and give money to whatever entity it feels needs it, fortunately state and local governments can't do so and the massive layoffs will reduce the tax-base and eventually pressure them to open things up. Countless bureaucrats at all levels of government see this as an opportunity to be heroes, get attention, act, grow their budgets, bring about their always "socialist" schemes causing even more dependence on government by the clueless public who more and more sees government/monopoly as the only way to coordinate an increasingly complex society. The government believes it can just add the needed "liquidity" to keep the economy going, send checks to people when the virus passes. This is simply allowing people to abandon the needed urgency and to continue to consume thus shrinking the economic pie more when they should be motivated to end this paralysis immediately. Again, these and countless other problems disappear if just a small percentage of the population understands freedom and quickly spreads such understanding to others.
