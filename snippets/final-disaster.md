### Ideas Leading to the Final Disaster: Coronavirus, WWIII



Let us now discuss the disastrous fallacies which are increasingly dominating the thinking of the fellow hordes of slightly smarter apes and their leaders/"experts" which will soon lead to the destruction of civilization if those of us who have had the miraculous luck of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/friends fail in spreading their wisdom. The root of all of our problems is obviously economic ignorance which eventually manifests itself in various socioeconomic "diseases"/wars/lockdowns and oppression needed to get everyone to go along with "the plan" that will fix the problems/Coronavirus/etc. This is similar to how our faulty diets eventually cause imbalances in the body that manifest themselves in various physical diseases. 

There is of course the most immediate danger, the Coronavirus lockdowns and related restrictions which are paralyzing production leading to socioeconomic chaos. Another dangerous side-effect is how the tribsalistic horde in the Trump administration wants to blame the Chinese for this worldwide calamity. It should be obvious to see that it was the unnecessary lockdowns brought about by Fauci and the medical "experts" which have destroyed civilization, not the pathogen itself. Even if it were true that this pathogen was the result of some negligence at some Chinese lab, wanting to punish or force the Chinese to pay damages is, well, tribalistic apeshit, even more ridiculous than the French/British forcing the defeated German citizens to pay for war damages was. 

There is also the usual economic ignorance and tribalism that eventually causes politicians to both increase paralysis of economy as they intervene and also blame other countries as is clearly the case with the USA becoming increasingly hostile towards China with tariffs and desire to "bring back manufacturing" to the USSA thus greatly harming the world-wide division of labor and everyone's standard of living. The Environmentalist mindset and its fallacies which also leads to central planning and the desire/need for some calamity to limit human population also continues to spread. And of course there is the most disastrous fallacy/myth of all, that some kind of world war is what will be needed or inevitable to fix the economy "like it did in WWII", especially as the Coronavirus lockdows and repercussions spread economic chaos and inevitable fingerpointing.
