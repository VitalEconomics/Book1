### Our dangerous times


Let us now discuss the disastrous fallacies which are increasingly dominating the thinking of the fellow hordes of slightly smarter apes and their leaders/"experts" which will soon lead to the destruction of civilization if those of us who have had the miraculous luck of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/friends fail in spreading their wisdom. 

There is of course the most immediate danger, the Coronavirus lockdowns and related restrictions which are paralyzing production leading to a shrinking economic pie and intensifying socioeconomic chaos/polarization. Another dangerous side-effect is how the tribalistic patriotic flag-waving horde in the Trump administration wants to blame the Chinese for this worldwide calamity. It should be obvious to see that it was the unnecessary lockdowns brought about by Fauci and the world's medical "experts" and bureaucrats which are destroying civilization, not the pathogen itself. Even if it were true that this pathogen was the result of some negligence at some Chinese lab, wanting to punish or force the Chinese citizens to pay damages is, well, tribalistic apeshit, even more ridiculous than the French/British forcing the defeated German citizens to pay for WWI damages. The 'War is good for the economy' myth must surely be spreading among our elected apes who will eventually find it necessary to have what will surely be a civilization-ending war with nuclear armed China. As usual, economic ignorance always attempts to destroy the world-wide division of labor and thus our very prosperity which was created by it by "bringing back manufacturing" to the USA from China to "protect our workers"/etc. and inevitably replace the superior swarm intelligence that emerges from the economic freedom of millions of individuals for some inferior 'National Economic Policy'. The Environmentalist mindset and its fallacies which also leads to central planning and the desire/need for some calamity to limit human population also continues to spread. 

As the "obvious" need to get everyone, especially the bad people, to go along with the numerous 'expert created' 'central plans' that arise from the aforementioned tribalistic economically ignorant fallacies, the label of traitor and curtailment of freedom of speech will inevitably arise. The perfect example of this was the banning by Youtube of a [video that in just a few days had reached over 5 million views](https://www.bitchute.com/video/56R2zmYXSfIK/) by Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Bakersfield California where they explained the relative harmlessness of the CV compared to what Fauci  their views and recommendation that lockdowns were counterproductive. In an interview about the matter, Youtube CEO Susan Wojciki, mentioned that they took the video down because "Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would [be a violation of our policy".](https://youtu.be/sPrbGU0Wyh4?t=271). Again, economic ignorance, ignorance of how superior information can only be discovered by competition and thus freedom, always leads to a 'central plan' that eventually necessitates coercion and the suppression and eventual vilification of dissenting views. It is no longer freedom and competition what determines the truth, it is the monopoly of experts at the WHO. This is not the result of some malice by Susan, she is simply the particular slightly smarter ape that inevitably rises to her position just like Goebbels inevitably emerged to fill a similar role in Nazi Germany. During the early days of the Bolshevik revolution, Lenin and his fellow communists were fiercely for principled freedom of speech. Many had experienced severe censorship and jailtime under the Tsar for expressing their views. But again, bad/complex ideas eventually show cracks and inevitable dissent and differing opinions, if they are to persist and require unity for their execution, they must be carried out by force and dissenting views suppressed.
