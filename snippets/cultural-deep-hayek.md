Remember how Alan was able to either maliciously or ignorantly use the ability to easily create money to restructure BlueIsle by creating his castle to the great detriment of the social order? And how the economically ignorant public actually wanted Alan to continue the money-creation to sustain the inferior order? Well, by far the most disastrous intellectual error that currently plagues the world's slightly smarter apes is the management of the world-wide economy by utterly clueless central bankers/politicians that, VERY IMPORTANTLY, abandoned the 'culturally evolved' gold standard. Once again, the institutions that create/sustain the social order, things like language, law, 'the market process' and all it is composed of like competition, interest-rate-coordination, etc., are the result of the wisdom discovered, not so much by our reason, but by 'cultural evolution'/competition, which includes perhaps the most important innovation of all, money. The evolution/emergence of the international gold standard was refined by 'cultural evolution' to contain wisdom hardly anyone appreciates. For example, since gold can't be "printed" and thus easily increased/controlled by a single body which can then use it to warp the social order via central planning like Alan did. The 'gold standard' inadvertently made it much harder for governments to grow thus keeping more wealth in the pie-increasing-innovating competitive private sector. A bad idea that requires directly taking wealth from people is much easier to correct than one which can acquire the wealth it needs by just creating money and sort of fooling the public/itself. The gold standard made it much harder for the slightly smarter apes to go to war with each another because the true costs/consumption of war will easily reflect itself in painful higher taxes and thus a proper cost/benefit analysis of the war by the public will help the ideas of peace and mutual understanding compete with the tribal/innate good/us vs. evil/them. But with inflation, such evolved constraints/wisdom which helped prevent war and central planning are discarded. It should then come as no surprise that the most horrific disasters the slightly smarter apes get themselves into, massive world wars and the viral spread of central planning ideologies to various degrees have coincided with the abandonment of the evolution-created-international-gold-standard and a move towards the "rationally" constructed "fiat"/paper/electronic convoluted mess we have today. In the old days, rulers/kings would sometimes run out of gold with which to pay their troops and the wars would end, but this would not be the case as central banking began to emerge, giving "great leaders" a new way with which to sustain and prolong to even more severe levels the destruction that war and central planning brings. As Prof. Salerno mentions in one of his many great lectures at the Ludwig von Mises Institute:

>“Wars have invariably been financed by printing money since the invention of paper money. Indeed, it might be said that paper fiat money and central banks were invented mainly to finance wars. The first irredeemable paper currency in the Western world was issued in 1690 by the British colony of Massachusetts in order to pay its soldiers in its sporadic wars of plunder against the French colony of Quebec. The first central bank in history, the Bank of England, was established in 1694 to finance the mercantilist and imperialist foreign policy of the Whig party that had gained control of the British government.”

The monopolizing of the banking and financial institutions by governments and their “experts” and regulations has not only helped create all sorts of crises, it has also retarded the further evolution of financial institutions themselves. The following quote by Hayek captures all this beautifully:

>“…Like morality, law, language, and biological organisms, monetary institutions result from spontaneous order — and are similarly susceptible to variation and selection. Yet monetary institutions turn out to be the least satisfactorily developed of all spontaneously grown formations. Few will, for example, dare to claim that their functioning has improved during the last seventy years or so, since what had been an essentially automatic mechanism based on an international metallic standard was replaced, under the guidance of experts, by deliberate national ‘monetary policies’. Indeed, humankind’s experiences with money have given good reason for distrusting it, but not for reasons commonly supposed. Rather, the selective processes are interfered with here more than anywhere else: selection by evolution is prevented by government monopolies that make competitive experimentation impossible.” (Hayek F. A., 1989, p. 103)

And again, more concisely:

>“the basic tools of civilisation – language, morals, law and money – are all results of spontaneous growth and not of design, and of the last two organized power has got hold and thoroughly corrupted them”


The image below is yet another simple powerful meme, one can easily see how once the US government abandoned vestiges of the gold standard in 1971 it just began creating more money with which to nourish its military consumption(Vietnam war, Iraq I/II, etc.) and all other expanding bureaucracies.
