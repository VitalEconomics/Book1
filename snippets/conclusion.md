Let us now discuss the disastrous fallacies which are increasingly dominating the thinking of the fellow hordes of slightly smarter apes and their leaders/"experts" which will soon lead to the destruction of civilization if those of us who have had the miraculous luck of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/friends fail in spreading their wisdom. 

There is of course the most immediate danger, the Coronavirus lockdowns and related restrictions which are paralyzing production leading to a shrinking economic pie and intensifying socioeconomic chaos/polarization. Another dangerous side-effect is how the tribalistic patriotic flag-waving horde in the Trump administration wants to blame the Chinese for this worldwide calamity. It should be obvious to see that it was the unnecessary lockdowns brought about by Fauci and the world's medical "experts" and bureaucrats which are destroying civilization, not the pathogen itself. Even if it were true that this pathogen was the result of some negligence at some Chinese lab, wanting to punish or force the Chinese citizens to pay damages is, well, tribalistic apeshit, even more ridiculous than the French/British forcing the defeated German citizens to pay for WWI damages. The 'War is good for the economy' myth must surely be spreading among our elected apes who will eventually find it necessary to have what will surely be a civilization-ending war with nuclear armed China. As usual, economic ignorance always attempts to destroy the world-wide division of labor and thus our very prosperity which was created by it by "bringing back manufacturing" to the USA from China to "protect our workers"/etc. and inevitably replace the superior swarm intelligence that emerges from the economic freedom of millions of individuals for some inferior 'National Economic Policy'. The Environmentalist mindset and its fallacies which also leads to central planning and the desire/need for some calamity to limit human population also continues to spread. 

As the "obvious" need to get everyone, especially the bad people, to go along with the numerous 'expert created' 'central plans' that arise from the aforementioned tribalistic economically ignorant fallacies, the label of traitor and curtailment of freedom of speech will inevitably arise. The perfect example of this was the banning by Youtube of a [video that in just a few days had reached over 5 million views](https://www.bitchute.com/video/56R2zmYXSfIK/) by Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Bakersfield California where they explained their views and recommendation that lockdowns were counterproductive. In an interview about the matter, Youtube CEO Susan Wojciki, mentioned that they took the video down because "Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would [be a violation of our policy".](https://youtu.be/sPrbGU0Wyh4?t=271). Again, economic ignorance, ignorance of how superior information can only be discovered by competition and thus freedom, always leads to a 'central plan' that eventually necessitates coercion and the suppression and eventual vilification of dissenting views. It is no longer freedom and competition what determines the truth, it is the monopoly of experts at the WHO. This is not the result of some malice by Susan, she is simply the particular slightly smarter ape that inevitably rises to her position just like Goebbels inevitably emerged to fill a similar role in Nazi Germany. During the early days of the Bolshevik revolution, Lenin and his fellow communists were fiercely for principled freedom of speech. Many had experienced severe censorship and jailtime under the Tsar for expressing their views. But again, bad/complex ideas eventually show cracks and inevitable dissent and differing opinions, if they are to persist and require unity for their execution, they must be carried out by force and dissenting views suppressed.


Whether mankind saves itself depends on how quickly/cleverly those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/friends' wisdom succeed at spreading it to fellow smarter apes. We must join Mises and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us."

Since it is a battle of ideas we must focus on those ideas which give us the most bang-for-the-buck. In other words, those ideas that can both explain the most as quickly as possible and also cause enough doubt on what the current crop of clueless "experts" are recommending(essentially more regulation/planning and 'Central Bank Socialism' by creating money to manage the social order). [Hazlitt wisely identified a focus on the basics on monetary policy and inflation](https://mises.org/library/task-confronting-libertarians) because it is easy to understand, teach, and immediately lets people know that it is the Central Banks that are responsible for the inflation, rising prices, and general growth of government. Hayek's focus on how competition spreads information and superior order and how governments prevent/slow-down this process is also easy and a powerful way to get people closer to the proper understanding of how private property leads to economic freedom which then leads to competition and superior order. We must also do our best to keep our cool and note get too deep into the "moral sphere". A problem of economic ignorance is only made far worse by vilifying the misguided/ignorant. Also concentrating on reaching famous people seems like a simple and great strategy. There is no reason why famous athletes and movie stars and others of influence can't understand how the world works. 

Mises again: 

>"Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man's human existence…All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of…economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines…Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories…As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake…all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."


>"The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race."


>"The fact that the majority of our contemporaries, the masses of semibarbarians led by self-styled intellectuals, entirely ignore everything that economics has brought forward, is the main political problem of our age. There is no use in deceiving ourselves. American public opinion rejects the market economy, the capitalistic free enterprise system that provided the nation with the highest standard of living ever attained. Full government control of all activities of the individual is virtually the goal of both national parties. The individual is to be deprived of his moral, political, and economic responsibility and autonomy and to be converted into a pawn in the schemes of a supreme authority aiming at a “national” purpose. His “affluence” is to be cut down for the benefit of what is called the “public sector,” i.e., the machine operated by the party in power. Hosts of authors, writers, and professors are busy denouncing alleged shortcomings of capitalism and exalting the virtues of “planning.” Full of a quasireligious ardor, the immense majority is advocating measures that step by step lead to the methods of administration practiced in Moscow and in Peking.
If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified “economic freedom,” the system of free enterprise and capitalism. The intellectuals and those who call themselves educated must use their superior cognitive faculties and power of reasoning for the refutation of erroneous ideas about social, political, and economic problems and for the dissemination of a correct grasp of the operation of the market economy. They must start by familiarizing themselves with all the issues involved in order to teach those who are blinded by ignorance and emotions. They must learn in order to acquire the ability to enlighten the misguided many.
It is a fateful error on the part of our most valuable contemporaries to believe that economics can be left to specialists in the same way in which various fields of technology can be safely left to those who have chosen to make any one of them their vocation. The issues of society’s economic organization are every citizen’s business. To master them to the best of one’s ability is the duty of everyone."


Be a "friend of mankind"

>"As should be increasingly clear, economics is a science which can make possible the construction of a social and political system in which human success is a feature of normal, everyday life everywhere. It is truly the humanitarian science, and only those who have studied it well and who are prepared to implement its teachings deserve to be called friends of mankind. The most important charity which true friends of mankind can pursue is to disseminate knowledge of this vital subject as widely and as deeply as they know how.” —George Reisman
