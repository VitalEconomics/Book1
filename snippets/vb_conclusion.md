## We must join Mises and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek/Hazlitt/Rothbard/etc., in other words, the so-called Austrian Economists'  wisdom must succeed at spreading it to fellow slightly smarter apes. We must find/join/persuade people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope, excitement and viral economic education. We must join Mises and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch [has plunged us."](https://cdn.mises.org/Socialism%20An%20Economic%20and%20Sociological%20Analysis_3.pdf)

We must become and inspire others to be "true friends of mankind", as one of Mises' greatest students, Prof. George Reisman writes:

>"As should be increasingly clear, economics is a science which can make possible the construction of a social and political system in which human success is a feature of normal, everyday life everywhere. It is truly the humanitarian science, and only those who have studied it well and who are prepared to implement its teachings deserve to be called friends of mankind. The most important charity which true friends of mankind can pursue is to disseminate knowledge of this vital subject as widely and as deeply [as they know how.”](http://www.capitalism.net/CAPITALISM_Internet.pdf)


Since it is an "intellectual battle" against economic ignorance for which nobody is really to blame, we must try to keep our cool by not turning a problem of economic ignorance into a moral one, which as Mises mentions bellow can only lead to "irreconcilable conflict". Questioning people's intelligence/sanity is also a great error. In just two consecutive paragraphs Mises does away with the they are "evil" and/or "stupid" fallacies:

>"The problems involved are purely intellectual and must be dealt with as such. It is disastrous to shift them to the moral sphere and to dispose of supporters of opposite ideologies by calling them villains. It is vain to insist that what we are aiming at is good and what our adversaries want is bad. The question to be solved is precisely what is to be considered as good and what as bad. The rigid dogmatism peculiar to religious groups and to Marxism results only in irreconcilable conflict. It condemns beforehand all dissenters as evildoers, it calls into question their good faith, it asks them to surrender unconditionally. No social cooperation is possible where such an attitude prevails.

>No better is the propensity, very popular nowadays, to brand supporters of other ideologies as lunatics. Psychiatrists are vague in drawing a line between sanity and insanity. It would be preposterous for laymen to interfere with this fundamental issue of psychiatry. However, it is clear that if the mere fact that a man shares erroneous views and acts according to his errors qualifies him as mentally disabled, it would be very hard to discover an individual to which the epithet sane or normal could be attributed. Then we are bound to call the past generations lunatic because their ideas about the problems of the natural sciences and concomitantly their techniques differed from ours. Coming generations will call us lunatics for the same reason. Man is liable to error. If to err were the characteristic feature of mental disability, then everybody should be called mentally disabled." [(Mises)](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/714)

Hayek also explains:

>"When I stressed that is genuine intellectual error that we have to fight, what I meant to bring out is that we ought to remain aware that our opponents are often high-minded idealists whose harmful teachings are inspired by very noble ideals. It seems to me that the worst mistake a fighter for our ideals can make is to ascribe to our opponents dishonest or immoral aims. I know it is sometimes difficult not to be irritated into a feeling that most of them are a bunch of irresponsible demagogues who ought to know better... if we have not yet convinced them, the reason must be that our arguments are not yet quite good enough, that we have not yet made explicit some of the foundations on which our conclusions rest. Our chief task therefore must still be to improve the argument on which our case for a free society rests."

Hazlitt, the author of the best-selling introduction to economics of all time ["Economics in One Lesson"](https://fee.org/media/14946/economicsinonelesson.pdf), greatly inspires below:

>"...the hard thing must be said that, collectively, we just haven't been good enough. We haven't convinced the majority. Is this because the majority just won't listen to reason? I am enough of an optimist, and I have enough faith in human nature, to believe that people will listen to reason if they are convinced that it is reason. Somewhere, there must be some missing argument, something that we haven't seen clearly enough, or said clearly enough, or, perhaps, just not said often enough. A minority is in a very awkward position. The individuals in it can't afford to be just as good as the individuals in the majority. If they hope to convert the majority they have to be much better; and the smaller the minority, the better they have to be. They have to think better. They have to know more. They have to write better. They have to have better controversial manners. Above all, they have to have far more courage. And they have to be infinitely patient."

Just like Socialism/Communism and our big-government problems are caused by viral economic fallacies and resulting perverse incentives that inadvertently lead to bigger government/monopoly growth and thus more coercion of wealth from the private sector, so too should we focus on viral bits of economic wisdom. It would seem wise to focus on those ideas that can both explain the most as quickly as possible and also cause enough doubt on what the current crop of clueless "experts" are recommending(essentially more regulation/planning and 'Central Bank Socialism' by creating money to manage the social order). [Hazlitt wisely identified a focus](https://mises.org/library/task-confronting-libertarians) on the basics on monetary policy and inflation because it is easy to understand, teach, and immediately lets people know that it is the Central Banks that are responsible for the inflation, rising prices, and general growth of government. Hayek's focus on how competition spreads information and superior order and how governments prevent/slow-down this process is also easy and a powerful way to get people closer to the proper understanding of how private property leads to economic freedom which then leads to competition and superior order. There is no reason why famous athletes and movie stars and others of influence can't understand basic economics and be likewise motivated to become "true friends of mankind".

Unimaginable peace and prosperity [are just around the corner!.](https://mises.org/library/case-radical-idealism) We just have to help our fellow citizens lose their fear of economic freedom and thus economic ignorance. The bigger the tax-cut, the bigger the job losses/wages in the public sector will be, but just as quickly, the bigger the job gains/wages will be in the private sector as tax-payers now have that additional wealth to spend. All that will happen is that a public sector employee loses his public sector job and quickly finds a private sector one. Instead of getting his paycheck/wealth by coercing the taxpayer as part of a massively-inefficient government monopoly and thus providing very little in return, he now joins a much more productive private sector order/company that is growing/hiring because tax-payers are now giving them more business/money/wealth with which to hire/sustain him. All wealth that is given by government has to be taken away coercively (or sneakily via inflation) from others who in a sense gave up a part of their lives to produce it. Whenever you get something from the government you are essentially consuming another person's life/order. This is not some moralist crusade against government, we just want to understand and minimize such inefficient coercion which when properly understood, most of us will find it immoral. The better people understand economics the more they will be willing to go along with these transitions to skyrocketing prosperity, even those who currently have relatively well-paid government jobs. Again, economic education is the key.


Today about 40% of all wealth is inefficiently consumed by the public sector (national/state/local/regulatory costs/etc.). For example, every year, well over 1.2 trillion dollars worth of civilian wealth in terms of homes, cars, energy, medicines, etc., (an amount similar to the entire productive output of Mexico which has the world's 15th largest economy), is taken away via taxes from the people in the private sector that created it, and consumed by the millions of people employed by the United State's national security bureaucracy/military and its associated contractors as they produce push-ups, military drills, nukes and other weapons of destruction. In 2015, for every dollar spent in research and development by the world’s ten biggest R&D spending corporations, companies that harmoniously integrate and nourish some of the most hardworking and talented people from nearly every corner/faith/ethnicity of the world, companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Volkswagen and six others…the United States’ National Security/Military bureaucracy consumed nine dollars (109 billion compared to over 1,000 billion). In all likelihood, yearly US Military-related spending/consumption is comparable to what the entire planet spends on research and development. Militaries, being massive government MONOPOLIES which are also protected by flag-waving tribalism/patriotism, take wasteful inefficiency to unprecedented levels leading to [$1,280 cups, $999 pliers, and $640 toilet seats.](https://mises.org/power-market/f-35-15-trillion-boondoggle) 

The meme below is another powerful reminder of the economic ignorance that is destroying the American economy and slowing down all of mankind's technological progress.

Is this really necessary? Wouldn't the world be massively more advanced and prosperous if the above and other private sector companies who are always innovating and serving mankind as best as possible had an extra trillion dollars worth of wealth with which to hire more people? And EVERY YEAR! I mean... isn't it obvious that we could do better? That the slightly smarter apes don't really need to prepare to slaughter each other? How about instead of the new "United States Space Force" we have a "Department of Peace" where 4 or 5 times per year members of Congress and their immediate families visit their counterparts in other countries? Ok, enough for a one hour or so read.

So natural selection created a sort of algorithm to discover information, create superior social order, and also very importantly! prevent the growth of falsehoods and incentive structures which lead to hard-to-change/paralyzing/dangerous/tyrannical orders/bureaucracies/Coronumism. Freedom of course, which is "the ultimate algorithm", and the competitive knowledge discovery that emerges from it. We just need to understand it, that's all. The average citizen has no need to become an expert in nutrition, or economics, or history, or psychology, or whatever, what he needs to become an expert in, which fortunately is not hard at all, is ensuring that there is maximum freedom and thus competitive knowledge discovery everywhere. It does not look like we will be able to change the fact that we are simply slightly smarter apes, which I think is kind of cool anyways, however, we can easily become "civilized" slightly smarter apes by understanding how private property and freedom and competition is what leads to civilization. By focusing on economic education we really strike at the root of the ignorance and errors from which all other problems arise.

Let's finish up with, what else, a few more quotes from Ludwig von Mises:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But ["then there is no hope left for mankind".](https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-part-2-chapter-viii-human-society/) 


The very last 3 sentences from "Human Action" stress that:

>"The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the [human race."](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/936)
