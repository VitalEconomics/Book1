## Preface


Well folks, it is that time again. Time for mankind to revert to its tribalistic nature and inadvertently bring about needless suffering like we did for centuries with our religious and more recent world wars. The great economists and evolutionary thinkers Ludwig von Mises and his protégé 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek played a little-known yet vital role in preventing economic ignorance from destroying the USA and Western Europe via their intellectual dismantling of Communism/Socialism in the early 20th century. The Russians, Eastern Europe, China and others weren't so fortunate and thus suffered immensely. Due in part to the Coronavirus and its related economic lockdowns/policies, the same economic fallacies have resurfaced with a speed that is quickly on its way to destroying civilization. What we call "civilization" has been around for an eye-blink in terms of human evolution and looks to be a temporary departure from 'The Law of The Jungle' as we head towards a downward spiral of socioeconomic chaos. What a shame that we are about to destroy the world even thought Mises and Hayek already explained it all. These men's ideas can no longer remain ahead of our times. As Mises predicted, either we succeed in spreading them to "the immense majority" or ["there is no hope left for mankind".](https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-part-2-chapter-viii-human-society/)
