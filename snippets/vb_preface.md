### Preface 

My beloved friend Harry Browne had a passion and great skill for helping Americans understand and appreciate the monumental importance that economic freedom plays in our prosperity and very existence. With the help of some supporters I am very happy to publish this small book that can help combat the economic fallacies that are the root cause of our problems.
