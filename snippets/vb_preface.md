### Preface 


I am running for US House of Representatives in Washington State’s Congressional District #9 as a member of the [Libertarian Party](https://www.lp.org/issues/) The purpose of my campaign is to spread an understanding of economics to as many people as possible.


I was born in Cuba, one of the few countries still under the spell of the fallacious and economically disastrous ideology of Communism. I came to Miami (Cuba 2.0) when I was 11 where I also got my degree in Computer Science at FIU. I now reside in Washington State where I work as a contractor for Microsoft.
