### Preface 


This short book is my 'Campaign Book' and summarizes a few of the most important ideas I'd like to help spread as I run for US Congress in Washington State, Congressional District #9 in the 2020 election.

This is an Open Source book which anyone can contribute to by going to its github repository at https://github.com/VitalEconomics/Book1 and gets updated frequently.
