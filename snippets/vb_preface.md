### Preface 


I am running for US House of Representatives in Washington Stateâ€™s Congressional District #9 as a member of the [Libertarian Party](https://www.lp.org/issues/) The purpose of my campaign is to spread an understanding of economics to as many people as possible.


I was born in Cuba, one of the few countries still under the spell of the economically disastrous ideology of Communism. After leaving Cuba as a 7 year old I lived in France and Spain before coming to the USA when I was 11. I grew up in Miami (Cuba 2.0), and got my degree in Computer Science at FIU. I now reside in Washington State where I work as a contractor at Microsoft. 

Looking out the window and noticing that every other country is far more prosperous should be all that is needed for Communists to realize that perhaps they are wrong. Unfortunately the same 'Central Planning' economic fallacies and perverse incentives that have keep Cuba poor and backward for over 60 years are inadvertently taking the USA towards what I jokingly like to refer to as "Coromunism" due to the free-market-shattering lockdowns and similar 'Central Planning' by the economically ignorant well-intentioned ideologues and masses who are behind such policies. It is monumentally important that we look at mankind's problems, not as the result of "good guys" vs "bad guys" but more as the result of intellectual error. 

"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)
