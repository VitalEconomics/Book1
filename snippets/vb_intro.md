### Introduction: Lessons from WWI and Why I'm Voting for Jo Jorgensen

In August 10, 1915, British physicist Henry Mosely, who would have probably won the Nobel Prize that year, died in perhaps the most disastrous error mankind has thus far made, The First World War (1914–18). Bright and pious German/French/British/Russian… students, fathers, engineers, "great minds" and "experts", who even shared a common European Christian faith, reverted to their tribal ape-like nature, and for God, honor, flag and country, slaughtered each other leading to about 18 million deaths. At 7:30 am July 1st, 1916 the 'Battle of the Somme' began. On this single day, just the British alone, had about 20,000 fatalities and 35,000 wounded. On that day a British soldier was either killed or wounded on average every second. The "honor" of a military career would lead to disproportionately higher losses for the upper classes for all belligerents. Germany's top general, Erich Ludendorff would lose two sons, as would future British Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law. British Prime Minister at the start of the war, Herbert Asquith, lost one. While about 12% of British troops would die in the war, 31% of Oxford's 1913 graduating class would die. This should help abolish the popular naive myth that politicians are quick to bring about wars while wanting to avoid personal loses in them. 

How can mankind build mindbogglingly complex microchips, smartphones, the Internet and so much more, yet still not have figured out something as simple as peace? Why is it that every day at Microsoft I interact with co-workers from Russia, China, Iran, Israel, etc. yet our tribalistic governments are mired in conflict? Is there something to be learned from the fact that in July 1914 so many people/Henrys/leaders/"experts" brainwashed themselves into such needless carnage yet hardly anyone today has the slightest clue why WWI was fought? Everyone in that tribal disaster died for absolutely nothing! Similarly, is there something to be learned from the fact that with the best of intentions and guided by numerous 'well-meaning scholars' millions during the 20th century fell for Socialism/Communism thus inadvertently bringing unimaginable suffering upon themselves? and that to this day hardly anyone in the entire planet knows why Communism IS 100% IMPOSSIBLE to implement without it leading to socioeconomic chaos/famines(explained below)? Based on a quickly-revised and later totally discredited "epidemiological model" which grossly overestimated the lethality of the Coronavirus pathogen by British Professor Neil Ferguson, in about 2 months the Coronavirus-related economic shutdowns and restrictions which have been strongly advised by 'well-meaning scholars' like top US Infections Disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and numerous politicians have led to over 38+ million Americans losing their jobs and have the USA and much of the world headed towards a WWI-like tribalistic socioeconomic calamity which might very well be mankind's Final Disaster. The three aforementioned calamities all have one common root. Massive ignorance of economics and what real Capitalism is. Massive ignorance of how due to economic fallacies mankind inevitably falls for horrific wars and socioeconomic calamities! As 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek tells us:

>"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)

>"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced." (Hayek F. A., 1973, p. 70)

The human body and the numerous “systems” that coordinate it like the respiratory, nervous, and digestive “systems”, is the result of the actions of some 30 trillion cells but obviously NOT the result of any conscious planning, designing, or conspiring by them. The brain does not tell cells what to do either. Similarly, the economy is also coordinated by a “system”, by what 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek and his great mentor Ludwig von Mises referred to as “The Market Process”. The workings of ‘The Market Process’ and the “parts” it is composed of like money, prices, ,economic competition, finance/banking and interest rates, is one of the most important concepts informed citizens should understand because a smoothly growing and progressing economy is the real source of our prosperity.

This book is written with a 'Misesian Ethos'. The great economist Ludwig von Mises wrote towards the end of his monumental treatise "Human Action" [(free PDF)](https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf) [(Amazon.com)](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-von-Mises/dp/1610161459/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=human+action&qid=1589443352&sr=8-1)

>"Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man's human existence…All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of…economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines…Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories…As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake…all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every [citizen."](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/932)

And in another occasion:

>"If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified "economic freedom," the system of free enterprise and capitalism. The intellectuals and those who call themselves educated must use their superior cognitive faculties and power of reasoning for the refutation of erroneous ideas about social, political and economic problems and for the dissemination of a correct grasp of the operation of the market economy. They must start by familiarizing themselves with all the issues involved in order to teach those who are blinded by ignorance and emotions. They must learn in order to acquire the ability to enlighten the misguided many.

>It is a fateful error on the part of our most valuable contemporaries to believe that economics can be left to specialists in the same way in which various fields of technology can be safely left to those who have chosen to make any one of them their vocation. The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of [everyone."](https://mises.org/library/mises-reviews-rothbards-man-economy-and-state)


This is why I am voting to make Jo Jorgensen the first female president of the United States of America. Because spreading an understanding of economics is 'in our age, the primary civic duty' and by supporting her free-market views we can help her become a beacon of economic education that can help millions overcome the economic fallacies that keep us mired in conflict and away from the prosperity all human beings everywhere in the world can enjoy.
