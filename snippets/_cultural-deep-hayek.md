#### Deep Hayek

We are now at a point where we can fully understand how our problems stem from the fact that 'the market process' and all the wonderful mechanisms it is composed of are "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design" and were design not so much by our reason, but by "processes of selective evolution" primarily via the aforementioned hayekian cultural evolution.

Hayek explains:

>"We have never designed our economic system. We were not intelligent enough for that. We have stumbled into it and it has carried us to unforeseen heights and given rise to ambitions which may yet lead us to destroy it." [(Hayek F. A., 1981, p. 164)](https://books.google.com/books?id=9IpEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA496&lpg=PA496&dq=%22We+have+never+designed+our+economic+system.+We+were+not+intelligent+enough+for+that.%22&source=bl&ots=unmrkCWHht&sig=ACfU3U3LTxMBTWY7xlzDtCXk_33E3TM_mQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjK8IzPs-7mAhUJvp4KHdyOB8UQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22We%20have%20never%20designed%20our%20economic%20system.%20We%20were%20not%20intelligent%20enough%20for%20that.%22&f=false)

With respect to private property:

>"…I am quite convinced nobody invented it for a known purpose, and to me the proof of this is that even now hardly anybody yet understands what the advantages of private property and the market society are." (Hayek essay "Individual and Collective Aims" published in "On Toleration" ISBN 0-19-827529-3)

Consider how hardly anyone in the world has the slightest clue regarding the fact that rising prices are due to government/central bank money creation. How it is that over and over and over and over again, something so simple and vital goes unnoticed leading to so much economic chaos. After WWI, the German government tried to do the impossible, provide enough wealth for veterans, numerous public sector bureaucracies, and ridiculous payments to the victors (France/England/etc.). They just printed the money leading to eventual hyperinflation where something that could be purchased with one German mark in July 1914 would cost 726,000,000,000 marks in Nov 1923. At times prices doubled every 49 hours. Graham writes:

>"The Reichsbank was finally reduced to making apologies for its inability to provide for a weekly output of more than several billion (or trillion) of marks of the required denomination and to an expression of its hope that this situation would be quickly remedied by an improvement in the speed of the printing presses! The printing presses did their bit. By the end of inflation the daily output of currency was over 400,000,000,000,000,000 marks.” (Graham, p. 35)

Even more obvious and relevant to our current times and Coronavirus self-destruction, consider how just about every politician, mainstream economist, and member of the mainstream media is solidly under the illusion that the government sending checks to people can provide the necessary wealth to sustain everyone while they lose their jobs and stop producing and we wait and wait for this Coronavirus to subside. The government and leading experts are solidly behind this disastrous myth. It is not the result of some "conspiracy" to destroy society. It is simply the emergent behavior of complex factors/incentives. 

Remember how Alan was able to either maliciously or ignorantly use the ability to easily create money to restructure BlueIsle by creating his castle to the great detriment of the social order? And how the economically ignorant public actually wanted Alan to continue the money-creation to sustain the inferior order? Well, by far the most disastrous intellectual error that currently plagues the world's slightly smarter apes is the management of the world-wide economy by utterly clueless central bankers/politicians that, VERY IMPORTANTLY, abandoned the 'culturally evolved' gold standard. Once again, the institutions that create/sustain the social order, things like language, law, 'the market process' and all it is composed of like competition, interest-rate-coordination, etc., are the result of the wisdom discovered, not so much by our reason, but by 'cultural evolution'/competition, which includes perhaps the most important innovation of all, money. The evolution/emergence of the international gold standard was refined by 'cultural evolution' to contain wisdom hardly anyone appreciates. For example, since gold can't be "printed" and thus easily increased/controlled by a single body which can then use it to warp the social order via central planning like Alan did, the 'gold standard' inadvertently made it much harder for governments to grow thus keeping more wealth in the pie-increasing-innovating competitive private sector. A bad idea that requires directly taking wealth from people is much easier to correct than one which can acquire the wealth it needs by just creating money and sort of fooling the public/itself. The gold standard made it much harder for the slightly smarter apes to go to war with each another because the true costs/consumption of war will easily reflect itself in painful higher taxes and thus a proper cost/benefit analysis of the war by the public will help the ideas of peace and mutual understanding compete with the tribal/innate good/us vs. evil/them. But with inflation, such evolved constraints/wisdom which helped prevent war and central planning are discarded. It should then come as no surprise that the most horrific disasters the slightly smarter apes get themselves into, massive world wars and the viral spread of central planning ideologies to various degrees have coincided with the abandonment of the evolution-created-international-gold-standard and a move towards the "rationally" constructed "fiat"/paper/electronic convoluted mess we have today. In the old days, rulers/kings would sometimes run out of gold with which to pay their troops and the wars would end, but this would not be the case as central banking began to emerge, giving "great leaders" a new way with which to sustain and prolong to even more severe levels the destruction that war and central planning brings. As Prof. Salerno mentions in one of his many great lectures at the Ludwig von Mises Institute:

>“Wars have invariably been financed by printing money since the invention of paper money. Indeed, it might be said that paper fiat money and central banks were invented mainly to finance wars. The first irredeemable paper currency in the Western world was issued in 1690 by the British colony of Massachusetts in order to pay its soldiers in its sporadic wars of plunder against the French colony of Quebec. The first central bank in history, the Bank of England, was established in 1694 to finance the mercantilist and imperialist foreign policy of the Whig party that had gained control of the British government.”

The monopolizing of the banking and financial institutions by governments and their “experts” and regulations has not only helped create all sorts of crises, it has also retarded the further evolution of financial institutions themselves. The following quote by Hayek captures all this beautifully:

>“…Like morality, law, language, and biological organisms, monetary institutions result from spontaneous order — and are similarly susceptible to variation and selection. Yet monetary institutions turn out to be the least satisfactorily developed of all spontaneously grown formations. Few will, for example, dare to claim that their functioning has improved during the last seventy years or so, since what had been an essentially automatic mechanism based on an international metallic standard was replaced, under the guidance of experts, by deliberate national ‘monetary policies’. Indeed, humankind’s experiences with money have given good reason for distrusting it, but not for reasons commonly supposed. Rather, the selective processes are interfered with here more than anywhere else: selection by evolution is prevented by government monopolies that make competitive experimentation impossible.” (Hayek F. A., 1989, p. 103)

And again, more concisely:

>“the basic tools of civilisation – language, morals, law and money – are all results of spontaneous growth and not of design, and of the last two organized power has got hold and thoroughly corrupted them”


The image below is yet another simple powerful meme, one can easily see how once the US government abandoned vestiges of the gold standard in 1971 it just began creating more money with which to nourish its military consumption(Vietnam war, Iraq I/II, etc.) and all other expanding bureaucracies.

The slightly smarter apes have a good understanding of how to pee, shit, rape, and kill, but when it comes to anything related to the recently evolved 'market order'/'Social Organism'/economics, like something as simple as knowing that general prices can only go up if more money is being created, or that war is the worst thing for mankind, the slightly smarter apes, including the "experts"/Krugmans/Keynes, are utterly clueless and rapidly drifting towards the final suicidal disaster as the Coronavirus scare is showing. Consider the following, right now you are an incredibly complex order, yet going without oxygen for a few minutes will cause a minor sort of “economic chaos” in your body that will make it impossible to recover from even if oxygen becomes available again. The same thing WILL happen to the social organism if the world-wide division of labor and monetary system breaks down, perhaps even for just a few weeks or less, or if a few key cities or financial institutions/system are disabled in either a cyber-attack or inevitable bug/error. The US Federal Reserve and other major central banks have kept interest rates “artificially low” thus creating the illusion that there are more bricks and thus misaligning in unsustainable ways the entire global economy for over a decade. Just like Alan and the economically ignorant islanders felt it was best for Alan to create more money to continue to hire them to expand the castle otherwise there would be “chaos”, our central bankers and “experts” find themselves in a situation where they have to create tens of billions on a daily basis to prevent a much needed reordering which requires massive "bankruptcies". But again, to the economically ignorant slightly smarter apes, what can in reality be a quick reordering towards prosperity is seen as "chaos". 

Again, we are slightly smarter tribal apes that have been "civilized" and turned into members of Spencer's "Social Organism" by the same process that turned solitary cells into complex multi-cellular organisms. "Processes of selective evolution". If every cell in our bodies suddenly had the same intelligence and ability to reason that we do, including our current understanding of biology, they would wake up to a bewildering complexity and attempt to use their "reason" to impose a supposedly superior plan/order and while doing so wrecking the far more intelligent systems that evolution/competition had fine-tuned for billions of years. The "reason" of so many intelligent and well educated intellectuals during the last couple of centuries led them to attack private property and the freedom that grows from it because they erroneously thought it led to 'exploitative capitalism', 'social injustices', and thought that central planning/regulation by well intentioned/educated "experts" would lead to far more prosperity. They were wrong of course, their "reason" proved to be far less intelligent than the evolved traditions which protected/invented "private property" and the 'market process' that emerged from it which hardly anyone at the time (or today) understood.

Albert Einstein is perhaps the perfect example of a "genius" who with the best of intentions would use his "reason" to provide what is essentially a recipe for the destruction of civilization via his economically ignorant push for 'central planning'/Socialism. In his 1949 article "Why Socialism?" he writes:

>"Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor…I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child." (Einstein, 1949)
